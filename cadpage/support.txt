******************************************************************

Weld County mapping is seriously broken.  Someone is stripping all of the line break characters out of the regular dispatch page.  If they had replaced them with something nice like semicolons, I could parse them with no problems.  If they replace them with blanks I would have had a few choice comments about the situation but could have worked with it.  But they are just gone leaving all of your data fields mashed up against each other.  I just can't parse that :(

All you can do is complain to your department or dispatch IT people.  If they can't get the issue resolved, you may have to switch messaging services.  CodeMessaging.com and Active911.net are recommended because they can push pages directly to Cadpage.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Handcent is the culprit.  They insist on being the top dog in the SMS queue, meaning they control whether Cadpage gets to see SMS text pages rather than the other way around.

Actually it is more complicated that that.  Cadpage, Handcent, and Go SMS are all fighting for the top slot, and the Android system awards that prize to the one that was installed first.  So you will find it starts working when you install a new version of Handcent, and stops working when you install a new version of Cadpage.  Which always makes it look like our Cadpage update broke things.

So what can you do, there are a few choices:
1) The latest version of Handcent has a new option to lower the input priority.  Presumably this will make it compatible with Cadpage, but this has not been conclusively confirmed.To get to it, select
   Menu > Settings > Application Settings > Lower Priority
2) You can uninstall Handcent and look for another messaging app, preferably after sending them a polite note telling them you won't put up with apps that don't play nicely with Cadpage.
3) You use the Handcent settings to blacklist the email/phone number dispatch uses to send you pages.  Then it nicely drops those calls back to Cadpage.
4) You can go to our download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/ where we keep the most recent version of Handcent that plays nicely with Cadpage.  Install that and things should work nicely.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

OK, let's try this:  Go to Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then Recalculate Payment Status, then immediately scroll to the bottom of the menu and select Email the Developer to send us an email from Cadpage.

This will send us an email to confirm what your Cadpage User email address is, as well as lots of other information to help us solve this.

******************************************************************

Direct paging is a cool feature that lets selected messaging services push CAD pages to Cadpage without using SMS text messaging.
Which means,
1) No SMS text message charges
2) No SMS text message size limits
3) It works on Android tablets

It only works if you are getting messages from a cooperating message service, which currently means either CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com.  CodeMessaging will only work with departments. Active911 works for departments or individuals.

Cadpage does not expect subscription payments if you are registered to get direct pages from one of these agencies.  We get part of they money you pay them.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
Active911 explanation
******************************************************************

Active911 is a messaging service that can push pages from dispatch to cell phones.  If you use a plain cell phone, Active911 uses text messaging.  If you use Cadpage or an iphone, Active911 can push pages without using text messages.

*******************************************************************
Will Active911 be available on Android?

Active911 is a separate Organization from Cadpage, though we do work very closely together.  Which means that any answer I give should be considered advisory.  You really should ask them if you want definitive answers.

Cadpage and Active911 have a symbiotic relationship.  Cadpage takes the roll of the Active911 client for Android phones.  Active911 depends on the message text parsers developed by Cadpage to drive their IPhone and cell phone traffic.  

The problem with this arrangement is that Cadpage lacks the ability to display responder status information that is integrated into the Active911/Iphone app.  We are aware of the deficiency, but thus far have not decided how to resolve it.  Cadpage will let you display the Active911 incident web page, but that page lacks the real time responder location display that makes the Active911/IPhone app so cool.  There are serious technical challenges to adding that functionality directly to Cadpage.  On top of that, Cadpage is an open source product.  Active911 is not, and they are understandably reluctant to put a lot of their map and communication code into an open source app where their competitors can access it.

******************************************************************

Here are the details in setting up Cadpage with Active911:
First, do you have an account with Active911?  If not you should contact them about getting set up.  You can do that by visiting their web page at Active911.com.  Click the contact link, then the "click here to sign up online" link in the right sidebar.

If someone already set up a device for you, they should give you the device number and activation code you will need.  If you do not have that, Go to their website and open the Member Access page.  Then select the correct department and open the Devices tab.  If there is a device entry for you, it will show the required device number and activation code.  If not it should tell you who to contact to set one up.  The device type needs to be set to Smartphone and the Page Type to "Cadpage Direct (Android)"  Make a note of the Device Key (or Access Code) associated with the device.

Next open the Cadpage settings on your phone.  Select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
This takes you to a web page where you need to enter the two part Device Key / Access code associated with the device.  If all goes well, Cadpage will display a notice that your Active911 direct paging connection has been activated.

At this point, Active911 will start sending you pages through the Internet data network instead of using SMS text pages.

Please let me know if you still have problems with Cadpage.

Good Luck,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

So, the department should have an account with Active911.  And everyone should have a device that is associated with that account.  Each user needs the numeric device number and the 4 character activation code associated with that device.  This is all information you get working with Active911.

Next open the Cadpage settings on your phone.  Select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
This takes you to a web page where you need to enter the two part Device Key / Access code associated with the device.  If all goes well, Cadpage will display a notice that your Active911 direct paging connection has been activated.

At this point, Active911 will start sending you pages through the Internet data network instead of using SMS text pages. 

Please let me know if you still have problems with Cadpage.

Good Luck, Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************
Trouble registering with Active911
******************************************************************

Very occasionally, people having trouble with registering with
Active911.  There are a couple things you can try, usually something works.

Go to the home screen and select Menu > Settings > Accounts and Sync
and make sure Background Data and Auto-Sync settings are enabled.  While
you are here, press the Google account setting and Sync Now.

Restart the device and try again.

This takes care of 95% of the reported problems.  If it does not there
are some odder tricks that are occasionally required.

Power down your device, remove the SD card, then power it up and
register Cadpage with Active911.  I have no idea why this would make any
difference, but it got one user up and running.

Double check your Active911 device configuration to confirm that it is
configured with a page type of Cadpage (Android).

Good luck,
-Ken

**********************************************************************

This could be one of two different problems.

1) the more common one is where your register Cadpage with Active911.  Active911 accepts the registration the confirmation never gets to Cadpage.  As a result, Cadpage does not show that you are registered with Active911 and your payment status does not give you credit for being sponsored by Active911, but you still receive direct pages from Active911.

2) Your Cadpage registration works successfully, Both Active911 and Cadpage report a fully activated status for a time.  But then something happens that unregistered your device on Active911, but not on Cadpage.

Which is your situation?

Good luck,
-Ken

**********************************************************************
Duplicate messages
**********************************************************************

That is fairly common for new Active911 users.  Usually you were getting text pages from dispatch or another service first.  These pages keep coming when you register for Active911 pages.  To stop them, you need to talk to someone in your department.  Probably the same person who got those pages sent to your phone in the first place.

Good luck,
-Ken

********************************************************************

Thanks for your PayPal payment!

Unfortunately, your PayPal account is most likely not how Cadpage knows you.  
PLEASE follow these instructions:
Go to Cadpage settings> Payment status > Hey, I've already paid for this > Send Email 
This will generate an email with the correct email account (usually a gmail account) we need for your registration.

Your Payment status should change when you load the next Cadpage version. 

In the meantime, I can give you a 30 day extension.  To get that, go into the Cadpage settings, press the Payment Status item, then the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
QLGSBIBA or qlgsbiba.    It is a time-sensitive code, and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days. 

Thanks again for your support,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

Thanks for considering the purchase of a Cadpage subscription!

The usual, and preferred method of purchasing a Cadpage subscription is through the Google Play Store.  You do this by going into the Cadpage Settings and pressing
Payment Status > Purchase through Android Market.
Purchases made this way will update your payment status almost immediately.

If that does not work, the web page at 
http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments
has  instructions on how to make PayPal or Snail Mail payments

Basically, you can mail a check or money order to

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR 97370

If you do this, please include your Cadpage User email address (usually a gmail address) so I can make sure you get credit for it.

We would really love to have departments sponsor Cadpage for their members.  But we have no way of contacting them other then getting staff and volunteer members to bring it up.  If you can talk them into it, they get a 30% discount or more!  Details can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/other-support-options.

In the meantime, I can give you a 30 day extension.  To get that, go into the Cadpage settings, press the Payment Status item, then the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
QLGSBIBA or qlgsbiba.    It is a time-sensitive code, and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days. 

Thanks so much for your support,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

I cannot find a payment from you.  Under what name was the payment made?  Have you recently changed your email address?  Is it possible that you or your department have paid for an account with Active911 or another messaging service?

It may not be necessary to locate that payment.  Go to Cadpage Settings and select
Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status
That will attempt to reload your payment status from information maintained on the Play Store or PayPal servers.  

If that does not work, try logging in to wallet.google.com or paypal.com.  From there you should be able to look up your Cadpage purchase and send us the date, time and transaction ID, and whether it was PayPal or Play Store.

We are very grateful for all contributions and apologize for any complications.

I found your free subscription to Cadpage as of _____.  

Go into Cadpage settings and press
Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status

If you are having other difficulties with Cadpage, please let us know.

Good Luck,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

If you are getting text pages through CodeMessaging, you need to register your device for Code Messaging direct paging.

Go into Cadpage Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > CodeMessaging.net > Register
and follow the directions.

Cadpage is free for direct paging users.

This should only take a few seconds. If that fails, please let us know.

Good Luck,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

Two different departments dispatched by the same center is easy.  You will get pages for both departments, but they both have to have the same text format, so Cadpage won't have any trouble handling both of them.  Things get a bit sticky if they are dispatched from different centers, but Cadpage can handle that as well.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Play Store / Android payment issues
******************************************************************

I found your Google Play Store payment record as of ______.  However, your Cadpage User email address has changed.  I have updated your account with your current email address.

Go into Cadpage settings, press Payment Status and then Recalculate Payment Status. This reloads your payment status from the market which will usually fix things.

If that fails, please contact us again. If you have changed your email address, that may be the issue. Our information from Play Store is limited.

Thanks so much for your support,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

****************************************************************

If it does not work, please check that you have the same Google Play Store account that you did on the previous phone.  Open the Play Store app, press Menu, then Accounts to view and possibly change your market account. Then try the Recalculate Payment Status again.

*****************************************************************
Dual use of Cadpage Subscription
*********************************

If you set up both phones to associate the same email account with Google
Play Store, then both will be credited for the purchased Cadpage
subscription.

**********************************************************************

Most of our users are volunteer firefighters or EMS workers.  My husband and I are both volunteers with our local fire department. Yes it is unfortunate that we have to ask people already volunteering so much time and energy to pay us for a cool app.  The reality is that maintaining and continually developing Cadpage is more than a full time job. We have to pay our bills somehow, and Google takes their fair share.

$10 per year is way out of line for what you normally expect to pay for a general purpose Android app.  There are two reasons why this is necessary.
1) Cadpage is an extremely high maintenance app.  We put out weekly releases, and every week there are usually 10 or so location parsers that have to be fixed, either because Dispatch changed the text format, or because someone found a corner case that wasn't covered by the existing parser.  Most apps get by with a release every 3 months or more.
2) The potential user base is a tiny fraction of what a general purpose app can expect.  Cadpage is a niche market app, appealing to the small number of people who work or volunteer in emergency services.  The same development costs have to be spread among fewer people.

We would really love to have departments sponsor Cadpage for their members.  But we have no way of contacting them other then getting staff and volunteer members to bring it up.  If you can talk them into it, they get a 30% discount or more!  Details can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/other-support-options.

In the interest of helping communities, we offer a  number of approved ways to run Cadpage without paying anything.
1) You  can ask for a free subscription.but you have to include a reasonable reason for not being able to afford $10 per year.  
2) You can simply reinstall Cadpage every 30 days.
3) If you (or your department) are currently using or can switch to using CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as your messaging service, Cadpage is free if you are using the direct messaging option.
4) There is an old unsupported version of Cadpage available on the Cadpage download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage.  This version will not bug you about paying for it.

Good Luck,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

It is kind of amusing that people think nothing of shelling out $50+ per month for a smartphone carrier plan, but balk at anything more than $2-3 for an app, no matter how useful it might be.

******************************************************************
Market problem
******************************************************************

What kind of problem are you having with your Cadpage payment?

You can log into to wallet.google.com and see if they list a reason why things aren't working, like an expired credit card.

We also take PayPal & snail mail payments,   Details on how to do that can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments

Basically, you can mail a check or money order to

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR 97370

If you do this, please include your Cadpage User email address (usually a gmail account) so I can make sure you get credit for it.

If you need a 30-day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
QLGSBIBA or qlgsbiba.  It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Thanks for your support,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

Try logging in to wallet.google.com and see if there is something that needs to be set up there.  If you don't have a wallet account, you may need to set one up.  If you have a wallet account set up with credit card or payment info, go back to your phone and open the Market app.  Then press
menu > accounts 
And make sure the account listed is the one you set up in wallet.google.com

Hopefully that will let you make Play Store purchases.  If it doesn't let us know and we will try to work something else out.

If you need a 30 day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
QLGSBIBA or qlgsbiba.  It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Thanks for your support,
-Ken

******************************************************************

If you can't map calls, Cadpage isn't really working and you shouldn't  have to pay for it.

So we need to fix things.  I can give you a 30 day extension to give us time to work on it.  To get this, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
QLGSBIBA or qlgsbiba.   It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ___.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.
 
Next, you need to send me the information on the calls that are not mapping.  You do this by long pressing the call and selecting Report Problem from the menu list.  That generates an email to us with lots of cool technical information I need to figure out what is wrong.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, got into settings and press the Email the Developer settings as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message.  Which will hopefully be enough to help me figure out what is wrong.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

No problem. I have added your name and current User email address to a backup authorization server.  
Try again going into settings, press Payment Status and then Recalculate Payment Status,

As always, please let us know of any further difficulties. 

Good Luck and thanks for your support,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************
** Release info
******************************************************************
******************************************************************

This will be fixed in the next release.  

Weekly releases are generally published every Thursday evening.  If you want it earlier than that this should be in beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage tomorrow morning.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

This is a sporadic but very frustrating problem with newer versions of the Android system that has been reported by many people and many different apps.  I implemented another round of published workarounds to see if I can resolve it in the next release.

The next release will probably be out next Thursday, but this fix is available in the beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage.  I would appreciate it if you could try installing that and see how things work with it.

Thanks,
-Ken

******************************************************************

This should be fixed in the latest release, now available on Play Store.

Thanks for reporting it,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Why do people have to pay for this
******************************************************************

You are going to have to install the regular Cadpage app first.  The free/no-support version doesn't have any of the support options you are going to need.

If you install the regular version of Cadpage, you have a 30 day evaluation period that you can use to work out whatever is going wrong.  If you're lucky, and it doesn't require any code changes, you can go back to using the free version when that 30 days is up.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

For the long story, see http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support.

Short answer,there are, and will always be, ways to run Cadpage without paying anything.

And, Cadpage is licensed under the GPL, which makes if free software in the "free speech" rather than "free beer" sense.  It allows anyone to copy the Cadpage source code and use it as the basis for their own product.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Locations
******************************************************************

You are still using the General location setting.  The general location doesn't really know anything about how your text messages are structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them.  To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to specify a location setting that will know more about your specific message format and can get a lot more information from it.

******************************************************************************

That's about as good as we can get with a generic location.  The generic parser has to process CAD pages of any format, and can only do this by making some very basic assumptions.  Assumptions that will frequently be wrong for specific locations.   You will get much better results by requesting a new location coded for your specific dispatch text format.

******************************************************************************

This isn't the text format we are expecting for <<LOCATION>>.  This happens all of the time and usually means you are dispatched from a different 911 center than we wrote this location for.  It just means we have to write a new location for you.

******************************************************************************

This isn't one of the many text formats we are expecting for Suffolk County.  Apparently dispatch changed the way page are sent and  we need to write a new parser for you.  

******************************************************************************

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to our main support address: support@cadpage.org.  If the messages are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and paste them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Good Luck,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

*****************************************************************

It will help when we get a location parser written for Vance County.  Unfortunately this could take a while.  Normally we get new parsers out within a week of being requested, but these are not normal times.  I've been completely overloaded with parser problem reports since the beginning of the year, apparently a lot of dispatch centers schedule major changes to their CAD software about that time.  I'm struggling to catch up on problem reports and want to finish those before I go back to implementing new location parsers.  It could easily be 3-4 weeks before I get this done.

I apologize for the delay,
-Ken

*****************************************************************

OK, <<<>>> will be supported in the next release, probably Thursday  If you want it earlier than that this should be in beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage tomorrow morning.

You are entitled to a free one year subscription for helping us set up a new location.  You just have to ask for it, preferably by using the Cadpage "Email the Developer" feature, so we know which account name has to be added to the subscription list.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

*****************************************************************

We are about ready to roll out an improved parser for you.  There are some mapping problems with some calls. Google could not locate any of the following.

If these address really exist, you can report them to Google as a mapping problem.  Find the correct location in maps.google.com, then click the Report a Problem link in the bottom right hand corner.  I pick Road/Street > Other road/street/path problem, then type in the search string and tell them that that search did not find this location.

If there is something we can change do a better job of finding the correct location, please let us know.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** DISPATCH FMT CHANGE?

Hi folks,

We have gotten a report that the <<<<>>>> dispatch text pages are no longer working with Cadpage.  I need to know if they are still working for you.  If they are, I will need to retain the current functionality when I rewrite the text parser.  If not, can you report any examples of what your text pages look like now.  Just long  press all of the calls and select Report Problem to generate an email to us with information about the call.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

*****************************************************************
** General problems
******************************************************************

When a call comes in as an SMS text page, and Cadpage doesn't do anything to it, it automatically appears in the messaging inbox.  So if you don't want non-CAD pages to be handled as general alerts, we just don't do anything.

Direct paging is different.  If Cadpage doesn't handle them, they just disappear.  Since this seemed like an undesirable outcome, Cadpage always handles a direct page message.  If it isn't a real CAD page it will be treated as  a general alert, regardless of the process General Alert setting.   However, many people are, like yourself, unhappy with this state of affairs.  But we aren't sure what to do about it.

Code Messaging is going to try to give users more options about whether non-page calls are sent to you or not.  But this really doesn't solve the problem, does it.

It would be easy enough to have Cadpage honor the process general alert setting for direct pages.  But as I explained, they will not show in you message inbox if we do this, they will completely disappear.  Is this what you would prefer?

In theory, I could turn the request into something that looks like an SMS text message and pass it to the messaging app.  This is a lot harder job that reading SMS messages.  To create them I have to get a lot of things  right.  But it probably could be done, and probably is the best solution to this particular problem.

Have a nice day,

******************************************************************

Not much we can do about that.  All network carriers have limits how long an SMS text message can be.  If dispatch tries to send you something longer than that, it gets truncated.  There are things the message sending service can do to get around that.  But nothing we can do on the receiving end.

The only thing you can do is switch to a different message sending service.  Two in particular, CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com, can send pages through the the data networks, bypassing SMS text message limits altogether.

Good luck

******************************************************************
* Direct paging delays 

This has been reported by a few people using direct paging.  The Google protocol we use to push pages out to Cadpage seems to suffer from unexplained delays.  If only affects a few people, but once it starts happening it seems to reoccur.  Usually restarting the device and reconnecting to your direct paging vendor fixes the problem.  To do that, go into settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct Paging

You can go to the Active911 member info page, select the devices tab and send yourself a test message to see how it is working.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
* Text paging delays 

This is being reported fairly often recently.  You are getting text pages, and the only reason Cadpage alerting will be delayed for text pages is because the messages are just not arrive at your device in a timely fashion.  If you want to prove this, go into Cadpage Additional Settings and check the box labeled "Pass Calls through to SMS Client".  With that set, all calls will be passed to your message inbox in addition to alerting Cadpage and you can confirm the extent to which the messages are delayed.

According to the message timestamps, it took only 16 seconds for the carrier to deliver this call to you, which would imply that the delay was introduced by the dispatch messaging service.  But this should not be considered hard proof, I have some suspicions that carriers are holding messages in a system queue for some reason and that the total delay is not represented by this number.

You can also try sending yourself text messages when these delays are observed to see if those messages are also being delayed.  But when it comes down to it, about the only thing you can really do is complain to the carrier and/or dispatch service about the delays.

It might be worth considering switching to another messaging service.  CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com are reasonably priced and can push pages to your device without relying on text messaging and will probably fix your delay problem.  Unless the dispatch center is slow getting the pages out, in which case they have logs to prove that and some clout to take the issue up with dispatch IT people.  And Cadpage doesn't bug you about paying for a subscription when you are getting direct pages from them.

Good luck,

******************************************************************
* Active911 registration issues

Very occasionally, people having trouble with registering with Active911.  There are a couple things you can try, usually something works.

Go to the home screen and select Menu > Settings > Accounts and Sync
and make sure Background Data and Auto-Sync settings are enabled.  While you are here, press the Google account setting and Sync Now.

Restart the device and try again

This takes care of 95% of the reported problems.  If it does not there are some odder tricks that are occasionally required.

Power down your device, remove the SD card, then power it up and register Cadpage with Active911.  I have no idea why this would make any difference, but it got one user up and running.

Double check your Active911 device configuration to confirm that it is configured with a page type of Cadpage (Android)

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
* Duplicate pages with Active911

That is a fairly common problem for new Active911 users.  Some time back, you arranged to have dispatch send text pages to your phone.  Those pages don't stop coming when you register with Active911.  As a result you always get two pages for each incident.

You have to talk to someone in your department about stopping the original text pages.  Probably the same person who got them sent to your phone in the first place.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Your phone is running Android 2.1.  Direct Paging relies on a Google messaging service that is only supported for 2.2 and up.  

Your options are limited.  First check to see if your vendor has any system upgrades available
main > Menu > Settings > Software Update > Check New
and try installing them.

If there are no updates available, your only option is to get a new phone, or root the existing phone and install your own OS.  Directions for rooting most phones can be found on the Internet.  The process isn't nearly as dangerous as it sounds.  The important thing to make an NAND backup as soon as you have the recovery partition installed.  You can use that to restore the phone to pristine unrooted status if that becomes necessary.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
LATE PAGES:

If you can long press one of the calls you get and select Report Problem to send them to us, I could give you a better idea what is happening.  I need to see all of the alerts that are associated with one of your calls.

*******************************************************************

Here is the long list of things to check when Cadpage is not working. Some things may not apply to you. The important steps are the last two.  They send us information about your text pages that we need to figure out what is wrong.

Do you have Go SMS Pro or Handcent or AT&T Messenger installed?  They have proven to be incompatible with Cadpage. We keep the most recent version of Handcent that works with Cadpage on our Download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/

Are you getting text pages from your dispatch center?  CadPage works by processing those text messages, if you have not arranged to have them sent to your device, CadPage will not do anything for you.

If you are getting messages going through to your messaging app, check to make sure that they are not MMS messages.  You do this by long pressing on one of the messages and selecting view message details.  This should tell you whether or not the message is an SMS text message or an MMS message.  If it is an MMS message, you have to to enable MMS message processing in the location settings.  But first read all of the warnings and disclaimers at http://www.cadpage.org/faq/mms-message-support.

Wait until the next text pages comes in.  If it still does not trigger CadPage, then use the Send Email to Developer feature to send us an email report.  This should include the most recently received text message, whether or not it was processed by CadPage, which gives us a lot of information we need to resolve the problem.

If the messages are triggering CADpage, but will not allow you to select map option: Long press the message to open the Options menu and select the "Report Problem" menu item.  This will generate an email containing all of the information we should need to track down the problem with this message.  You can get the same menu options from the call history screen by long pressing one of the call entries.

Please contact us again if you still have problems.

Good luck,

******************************************************************

This looks like a text pages from Active911.  We do not have a parser for Active911 text pages because Active911 generally only sends text pages to dumb cell phones.  For Android phones running Cadpage, you should register as a direct paging device.

First, either you or the person in your department who sets these things up should open the Active911 web site member access tab, switch to devices, and set your particular device up with a device type of Smartphone and a page type of Cadpage (Android).  There is a device key associated with your device that you will need for the next step.

Next, open Cadpage settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
Follow the directions which including entering the two part device key.  If all goes well, Active911 will accept your registration and send a confirmation to Cadpage, which will display a note saying you are now registered for direct pages.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

I need more information about your calls to figure out what is going wrong.

If you have calls that are not mapping, long press the call and select "Report Problem" from the option menu.  That generates an email to us with the info about the call.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, got into settings and press the Email the Developer settings as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message..

Have a nice day,

******************************************************************

Next problem.  Even with the fixed parser, this call isn't mapping because it looks for an address on 
SAW MILL RD
which Google doesn't find because it thinks the street name is
SAWMILL RD.

If Google has the incorrect name (it happens) you should report it to them as a problem.  Find the location in maps.google.com and click on the Report a Problem link in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  They will usually get it fixed in a month or so.

On the other hand, if Google has the correct name, let us know and we can change the page parser to rename that street name if it sees it again.

******************************************************************

This call parsed fine (with the fixed logic) but it isn't mapping.  Google can't find an address for
<<< LOCATION >>>

Does this address really exist? If it does, you short report this to Google as a search problem.  Just locate the correct location with a web browser using maps.google.com, click the Report a Problem link at the bottom right corner of the screen.  I click other for a type and tell them that the above search string did not find this address.

If Dispatch has the address wrong, or if there is something we can do to come up with a search string that will locate the correct address.  Let us know what it is and we will try to make that adjustment in Cadpage.

have a nice day,
-Ken

*** Scanner setup

You have to set up some things before the Start Radio button will work

1) You have to install the Scanner Radio or Scanner Radio Pro app.

2) Open the Scanner Radio app and select one or more favorite channels that you want to listen to.

3) Then, open Cadpage Location Settings, scroll down to the bottom and use the Scanner Channel setting to select one of the Scanner Radio favorite channels.

4) If you want the channel to open automatically when a new call is received, check the box labeled "Auto Open Scanner Channel".

The Start Radio button should now launch the Scanner Radio app listening to the selected channel.

This doesn't magically turn your Android device into a shortwave radio receiver.  Scanner Radio works by relaying Internet feeds from volunteers across the country who have set up audio feeds from real hardware scanners.  If no one has set this up in your area your are out of luck.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
*** Scanner problems

Everything looks like it is set up correctly. Check to make sure that the scanner channel you are trying to active is still online.  If it is not, Scanner cannot play it.

If that isn't it, I need to see a copy of the system log recording one of these launch failures.  You can install any number of log viewing apps, I use Logcat myself, and use it to email a copy of the log to support@cadpage.org.  This needs to be done right after you get a call that fails to launch scanner radio.

Good luck,
-Ken

*** For NEW messages:

Cadpage will not do anything with your current settings.

First, make sure you are getting text pages sent to your phone when a call is toned out.  If you are not, talk to someone in your department about getting that set up.

Next, go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or work.  If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, please let us know if you would like the details of setting up a new location.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting.  Set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support.

The intended purpose of Cadpage is to support emergency responders who get text pages from a central dispatch center when they are asked to respond to an emergency.  Cadpage takes those pages, displays the information from them, and gives the user the option to bring up a Google map showing the location of the incident.Then they can ask for directions to that location.

******************************************************************
Details on setting up a new location
*****************************************************************

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to our main support address at support@cadpage.org.  If the messages are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and past them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list.

A location parser has to be written for each particular dispatch text format, generally that means one for every dispatch center.  We have not yet tried to write a location parser in any language other than English, but I would be happy to give it a try.

There are only two reasons why the Direct Paging Vendor menu will be grayed out.

The most likely, and most difficult to fix, is that direct paging is only supported in Android 2.2 and up.  If you phone is still running Andoroid 2.1, you need to either upgrade your phone system, or purchase a new phone.  Carriers are notoriously slow about providing upgrades for the phones they sell you.  If you can't get one through the normal channels, you may have to look into rooting the phone and installing your own Android system.

The second possible reason is that you installed and are running the free/no-support variant of Cadpage.  Direct paging is not supported by that variant.  If you are using it you will need to install the regular version of Cadpage.  You will not be expected to pay anything for it, Cadpage is free for user registered with Active911.

You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are displayed in bold text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a (Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,

iphone questions
******************************************************************

The developer doing Cadpage/IPhone is having trouble getting it accepted by the App Store.  Apple runs a really tight ship, and there are several prohibitions listed in their terms of service that Cadpage skirts around the edges of.  Active911 got in, despite doing essentially the same thing, only because the developer included pages of explanations why Active911 doesn't really violate those prohibitions.  Jesse is currently using all of those argument to try and appeal the Cadpage rejection.  How that will turn out is anyones guess.

Even if it were available, it probably wouldn't be much help.  The problem is that the IOS environment is a lot more restrictive than Android.  Unless you have a jail broken phone, it is not possible to pick up 
text messages the way we do for Android.  The only way Cadpage will work is if you get pages from a message service that can push pages to Cadpage without using text messaging.  And right now there are only two message services: Active911.com and CodeMessaging.net.  Please try one of those.

Good luck,

Mapping from wrong system

Cadpage is an Android app that generally will not run on a PC system.  We do have some clever users that have gotten it running using the BlueStacks Android emulator.  Obviously the Windows hardware will receive text messages, so the pages have to be delivered through one of the two message services (CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com) that can push pages to Cadpage without using text messaging.

We don't officially support this, and it is a lot of work to set up.  But it can and has been done.

The old RingtonePickerActivity crash.  We see this every now and then.  Only with your specific model of phone and only with that particular version of the Android operating system.  A problem report has been opened for this
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15472
But nothing seems to be happening with it, unsurprising as developers aren't all that interested in things that only happen to a vendor specific and probably customized version of Android.

If you can get a Android upgrade from your vender, most people are on 2.2 by now, I would install that.  Otherwise you might want to consider rooting your phone and installing your own Android system.  Failing that, you will probably just have to live with this.

Good luck,

Basically, they have to find a way to send SMS text messages to individual mobile phones.  I've never been involved in that process.  It sounds like this may involve two or more parties with dispatch sending an email to one specific email address where some other agency takes charge to pushing it out to the mobile phones.

As for how the text message is formatted, we can work with just about anything, but we really like obvious delimiters between fields and consistent field usage.  Presumably they are using some kind of CAD software, and that will probably limit there message formatting options.

If they are entering free form text, I would recommend something like

call description; address; @place name; #apt; city; cross st 1; cross st 2; general info

Place name and apt are optional, you can skip them if they aren't needed.  We can tell if they are present or not by checking for a leading @ or #
Samples

STRUCTURE FILE; 322 N PINE ST; @MOTEL 6; #7; PORTLAND; 1ST AVE; 2ND AVE; SINGLE APT FIRE
GRASS FILE;124 E 16TH ST; CHICAGO; BROWN AVE;; ABOUT 50 FT DIAMETER

note that double semicolons are used to leave an empty field where there are less that two cross streets

Hope that helps,

******************************************************************

Unfortunately, this problem originates deep in the Android operating system.  Something that we, as application developers, cannot address directly.  All we can do is collect as much information as we can and report it as a problem on the Android forums and hope someone gets around to fixing it someday.  If we are real lucky, this experimenting might identify some configuration settings that triggers the crash, and that you can avoid by changing that setting.

Does it happen every time you get a CAD page, or only this particular message?  Does it happen when you get non-CAD pages?  How about when Cadpage notifications are disabled?  Or when SMS pass through to Messaging app is enabled?  How about when you use the test last message option in the location settings?

Something that would really help is to install an application viewer (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after a crash.

Good luck,

It is possible to past text from the search history into an email, it just isn't obvious.

1) Bring up the message display and map it.
2) Press the Map app search box or search button.  This brings up a list of past map search strings.  The one we want is at the top  of the screen.
3) Use the Trackball/optical mouse to select the top entry, which moves it into the search box.
4) Long press the search box.  When you get the long press menu select copy.
5) Next return to the Cadpage display dialog
6) Select menu then report problem
7) Leave both checkboxes checked and press Send
8) This puts you into the mail app with a prefilled message.  Long press the top of the message and select paste from the long press menu
9) Hopefully you just inserted the Map search string into the message.  Send the message.

***************************************************************************

Not directly, for a variety of complicated technical reasons, Cadpage support for emailed alerts is just not going to happen.

There are indirect ways to make this happen.  The best is to sign up with the Active911.com messaging service.  They can take your email alerts and push them to Cadpage without relying on text messages, which avoids a lot of problems.

Alternatively, all cell network vendors maintain email address that will turn email into SMS or MMS text messages.  You can either forward or direct your email alerts to these addresses.

For Verizon, the email address are
NNNNNNNNNN@vtext.com for text messages and
NNNNNNNNNN@vzwpix.com for MMS messages

Other vendors have different gateway addresses.

Have a nice day,

***************************************************************************

Google navigation responds to navigate requests, which are different that map requests.  We could provide an option to have Cadpage send a navigate request instead of the map request, but have chosen not to for a couple reasons.

First it isn't necessary.  I takes you two taps to get from Google maps to Google navigation.  Tap the address bubble that displays on the map screen, then the directions button.  If you go into the Map app settings and select Labs, and then enable the Bubble Buttons feature, it will put a navigation button in the address bubble, saving you a keypress.

Second, Cadpage/Google Maps are good, but they are not perfect.  Occasionally Google Maps will find a completely totally wrong location, sometimes in the next state or county.  Having to go through the map app to get navigation directions gives the user a chance to eyeball the general location and observe that the mapped location is totally bogus.   If we let users jump directly into navigation, they might not figure out that the mapped location was wrong until they were halfway to the next county.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

The bad news is that Cadpage isn't going to work in your district.

Cadpage expects a text message from dispatch that contains all of the address and call information it needs to generate a map location.  Alas, your district looks like one of the old ones that can not or will not generate text messages when a call is dispatched.

The text messages you are getting aren't coming from Dispatch.  They are coming from a messaging service agency which has found a clever way to work around the dispatch center's failings.  They have some radio equipment in your area that listens for dispatch tones on the dispatch frequency, and saves the voice communication the immediately follows it.  This is uploaded to their server, which then generates the text  messages to everyone on the distribution list.  The text message gives users a link that user can click on which downloads the original voice message from the agency server and plays it.  Yours is a bit different in that they actually attach an audio file to the text message that contains the dispatch message.

It is a clever solution, but unfortunately not one that Cadpage can take advantage of.  To retrieve the call information, we would have to open the audio file ourselves and run it through a speach to text converter, then parse the result.  It would be an enourmous amount of work for what, we hope, will be  very small number of users.

Sorry for the bad news,
-Ken

You don't have to go back to text messages. All you have to do is stop installing new Cadpage releases.  You can run the current version of Cadpage forever, all it will do is display a modest red demo expired notice when time runs out.

******************************************************************

As best we can tell, Oneida county sends dispatch alerts with line breaks between fields.  But at least one of the forwarding services they are using to convert those alerts into SMS text pages is stripping out the line breaks and leaving nothing to separate the data fields.  As a result, they all run together, and there is no way for use to accurately split them out again.

Some users, at some times, have gotten text messages with the line breaks intact.  Other users have gotten text messages with the line breaks have been replaced with '>' symbols.  Both of these can be handled.  But users who get text messages where the line breaks have been removed are SOL.

Someone needs to track down how these dispatch alerts get generated and talk someone into changing things.  If the unidentified forwarding service will either leave the line breaks in place, or replace them with something else, all will be well. If Dispatch can use some other character to separate data fields in the dispatch alerts, it won't matter what the forwarding service does with them.

Good luck,
-Ken

I'm trying to make enough from Cadpage users to keep making this my full time occupation.  I think this is in the users interest, if I can't do this and have to get a real paying job, Cadpage maintenance will decline dramatically.  And the way text formats change all over the time, that would make it unusable for large numbers of people.

I'm asking for $10/year, which isn't very much in terms of how much people usually pay just to have an Android phone.  But I'm also committed to making sure people who can not, or just will not, pay anything can continue to use it.

1) You can roll back to the v1.4.32 version has no real enforcement logic.  If the demo runs out it will just display a demo expired notice and go happily on its way.
2) If you run through the payment status menu, there is a "I can't afford $10" that gives you a chance to send us an email explaining why you can't pay that.  I'm pretty easy with these, as long as you don't insult me I'll probably give you a free 1 year subscription.
3) You can uninstall and reinstall Cadpage, which resets the 30 day demo clock.  You can do this as often as you want. Cadpage tries to make this easier by giving you a Reinstall Cadpage button when the demo expires.

It is also worth mentioning that Cadpage is distributed under an open source license.  Which makes it free software in the "Free Speech", rather than the "Free Beer" sense.  Anyone who doesn't like the way I am running things is free to take the source code and use it to create their own product.

Hope that makes sense.  If you have any better ideas on how we can keep Cadpage running, I would be happy to hear them.

***************************************************************************

OK, this is going to get a bit complicated.

You must be using the general location.  Current versions of Cadpage suspend the evaluation period while you are using the generic location, largely because performance and reliability are so poor and you aren't getting the full benefit of the Cadpage product.  That's what gives you the sponsored by Cadpage message.  If you had a recognized paid subscription along with the General location, it would have reported that.  But when you switched phones and lost the paid subscriber status, it started report the sponsored status rather start report you as having a limited time evaluation demo.

If you were using a supported location before the phone switch, just go into Location settings and select that location.  Then reload the payment status and all should be as it was.

If you were using the general location before the phone switch, there is no real problem, you can run Cadpage like this forever without it bugging you for more money.

Or you can go into Location settings and temporarily select a real location specific location.  That will put you back in demo mode, which will let you reload the payment status which should fix everything.  After which you can switch back to the general location.

But what we really want you to do is request a new location for your area.  That will probably be ready for the next release, and after you switch to that one location you can reload the payment status.

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to are main support address support@cadpage.org.  If they are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and past them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list and get it added.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the from: filter to whoever appears in the from: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Have a nice day,
-Ken

I do have concerns about using Cadpage as your primary navigation tool.  It is pretty good, but it is only as reliable as Google maps, and Google maps has some weaknesses.
1) It's ability to accurately find an address accurately goes down substantially in areas where it doesn't have access to property rolls.  Which appears to be the case for your area.
2) It can't find interchanges, overpasses, and mile markers.  This is principally a problem with limited access highways, which are, again, common in your district.
3) It won't tell you about special conditions, like bridge weight limits, that might be in your department map books.  You can remedy this one by setting up custom map layers.

I've been impressed with how well it works, and would actually consider using it as a primary navigation tool in districts like ours, where Google does have access to online property rolls and we have no limited access highways.  But unfortunately your district appears to lack those two conditions.

Still, Cadpage official policy disclaimer reads....

This application should NOT be used as a primary dispatch method. Neither the developers or Google will be responsible for sending you to the wrong address or mapping errors. It is your responsibility to determine if the address looks to be correct and to have an alternate means of verification. This is a supplemental aid only and can be wrong, fail to operate correctly, crash, or in some other way not work as intended which usually happens at the worst time possible. We try to make the app work in the best manner possible and to not crash and in general it should not attract hungry brown bears to your location. However there are no guarantees made.

Have a nice day,

I'm getting several complaints that notification sound doesn't work (unless the Notification Override is on)  Whis is very puzzling because I haven't changed anything about the notification logic for probably more than a year.

Of course, my sound plays with no problems whatsoever, which makes it hard to tell what is going wrong.

In the grasping at straws category, try cycling power on the device.  It's worked before for odd sound problems.

If that doesn't work, we're going to have to look at your system log.  Ty installing a log view (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after you get a Cadpage alert.

Good luck,
-Ken

Blackberry Users

Cadpage was developed as an Android app.  An IPhone version is in the works, 
but that only happened because an IOS developer was wanted to do it.  We 
haven't heard from anyone who wants to develope a Blackberry version.

Good luck,
-Ken

Sponsored Locations

An emergency dispatch center or a collection of departments served by that center can choose to sponsor the Cadpage location that services that center.  End users using only sponsored locations will not be expected to make any further financial contributions.

Department Sponsorship

This is more suited for single departments.  Each department is responsible for maintaining a list of the members they are sponsoring.  When the list changes, the entire list should be forwarded to the Cadpage support address and we will incorporate it into the next release.  Users on the sponsored list are considered to have a paid subscription for the year.  See Department Member List Format for the required list format.

Pricing

We expect payment of something like $5 / user for sponsored locations and $7/user for department sponsors.  But we aren't keeping track and will accept pretty much anything you decide to give us.  Prices may jump in future depending on events beyond our control, see Pricing Disclaimer.  Checks can be mailed to

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR, 97370

Or you can ask us to send you an invoice

** Response Button Setup **
  
If you want to report your responding status to IamResponding, you can configure Cadpage to call the phone number that IamResponding give you.  To do that, go into Cadpage settings and select
Additional Settings > Button Configuration > Response Button Menu
and set the Button 2 Phone/Code setting to the number you would like to call.
  
If you want, you can get more complicated and set up multiple response buttons with different titles calling different phone numbers.  If you do, make sure you leave one button with no PhoneCode setting that you can use to close the response button menu without calling anybody.
  
Have a nice day,

** MMS doesn't work with Jellybean **

The logic Cadpage uses to handle MMS messages relies on some undocumented back door interfaces to the messaging system.  As of Jellybean (Android 4.1) these throw a security exception.

I added some code in the next release to trap the abort.  So it won't crash on you.  But it probably won't work either.  If you really aren't receiving MMS pages, you can turn processing off by going into Location Settings and changing the Message Type Processed setting to something that does not include MMS messages.  Problem solved!!

If you are getting MMS pages, there are not many options.  The code in the new release might work, especially if you the message options set to download the data content automatically.  But we just don't know.  Won't be able to do anything about it till I get a Jellybean phone of my own, which will hopefully be in a couple weeks

You could revert back to the ICS version of Android where MMS logic apparently works.  Or you can sign up with the Active911.com message service.  They have a way of pushing long pages to Cadpage without relying on SMS or MMS messages.  Their fees are reasonable.  Cadpage gets a share of what they charge, so we don't except Cadpage users getting direct pages from Active911 to pay anything further.

Good luck,
-Ken

Dear ____ Department --

I have been doing some internal auditing of our Cadpage app and found that there is no record of your payment.  

I have the following members registered as Cadpage Users as of __________:

________
________

A Cadpage subscription is $10 per year, but department sponsorships are given a 30% discount.  Therefore this account would only amount to $21. I can prepare a more formal invoice at your request.  The subscription will expire on ______.

Please let me know if this is in error, or if you are having any problems with Cadpage.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

Does Cadpage require an active data connection?

Yes it does.  It needs either Internet connectivity or an active phone
connection to receive the dispatch pages in the first place.  And it
needs Internet connectivity to map the call locations.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

*************************************************************************

We have never gotten a good handle on this problem.  When you have the Override Notification setting checked, Cadpage skips the usual notification procedure and instead uses the Media Player to play are specific alert tone at full volume.  One some devices, the Media Player apparently cannot play our alert ringtone and Cadpage crashes.  Exactly why only those few devices are impacted remains a mystery.

The simple workaround is to turn off the Override Notification setting in Notification Settings.  Hopefully someday we will come up with a better solution.

Good luck,
-Ken

*************************************************************************

Most likely you do not have to completely uninstall and reinstall Cadpage.  As long as Cadpage believes it is still connected to CodeMessaging, going into Cadpage Settings an selecting
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct Paging

will usually fix things.

We are still trying to identify why this happens.  What we know is that something happens with your device that tells Google the connection to it has been broken.  The next time CodeMessaging or Active911 try to push a page to your device Google tells them the connection is broken and they unregister your device.

We know that simply leaving the phone powered down or off the grid for an extended period of time will not break the connection.  We know that uninstalling and reinstalling Cadpage, or restoring it from some kind of backup, will.

But since you probably have not done one of those things, there seems to be some other condition that breaks the linkage.  Which might or might not be connected with installing a new version of Cadpage.  If you can identify any action or event on your phone that seems to be associated with this broken connection condition, it would be a big help.

Good luck,
-Ken
