* Cannot make Android market purchase Cadpage version 1.6.53
***************************************************************************

That was my mistake.  I put a rushed Cadpage release in response to a serious crash problem that had a beta version number.  A new release with the correct version number was early yesterday.  As soon as that gets installed you should be able to make normal android market place purchases.

Thank you very much for your support,

***************************************************************************
* Android 4.4 (Kit Kat) long explanation
***************************************************************************

Prior Android 4.4, apps have the ability to register for SMS messages at a higher than normal priority.  This lets them get a first look at SMS pages and, if it turns out to be something they need to process, block those messages from appearing in the default messaging app.  Cadpage has made use of this capability, as have a number of security and theft prevention apps.

Unfortunately, a number of third party messaging apps, Handcent and Go SMS in particular, have misused this feature to grab the highest possibly priority slot, intercept all text messages, and block them from being received by competing messaging apps.  This has been a major problem for Cadpage, and other messaging app developers which have been pretty much forced to adopt the same practice in self defense.  The most recent version of Google Hangouts has started doing this as well.

In Android 4.4, the rules all change to eliminate this nonsense.  The user gets to specify one default messaging app, that app always gets the text pages, and only that app has access to the message database and only that app can send SMS messages.  Other apps, such as Cadpage, can continue to receive SMS messages, but will no longer be able to block them from going to any other apps.

The good news is that Cadpage will continue to function under Android 4.4.  The bad news is that we will no longer be able to block dispatch pages from appearing in your default message inbox.  The best you can do is use a blacklisting feature in the default message app to prevent dispatch pages from appearing there.

And, of course, if Cadpage is getting direct pages from Codemessaging.net or Active911.com, nothing will change.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

* AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
* Cadpage triggered bugreport dump
***************************************************************************

This is a Google problem that they do not have a solution for yet.  Something about recent releases of the Google Play Services is breaking GCM registration for a very small number of users running Gingerbread phones.  It looks like happen to be one of those unlucky few.

The latest version of Cadpage does have some extra logic to help Google identify the source of this problem.  That logic has been tripped on your phone and created a file on your SD card that needs to be emailed to us so I can forward it to the Google engineer working on this problem.  The simplest way to do that is probably to connect your phone to a PC as a disk and copy the file Download/bugreport.cadpage.gz from your phone SD card to the PC and then include in an email to ken@cadpage.org.

Actual fixes or workarounds are still elusive.  Google recommends a factory reset.  But they say going in to the Application Manager, finding the "Google Services Framework" app and clearing both the cache and data *MAY* help.  They prefer the factory reset, but I won't tell if you try the clear data first.  In any case, let me know how things work out.

I would check to see if a system update is available.  Open Android Settings and select
About Device > Software Update > Check Updates
If there is a system update available for your phone, it will get you beyond the version of Android where this problem occurs.

If there is no update available, and you happen to have a Verizon phone, you can try calling tech support and complaining that your phone has no upgrade path to Android 4.0 and critical software apps cannot run on the old version you have.  Sounds like a long shot, but the first user I had run into this got Verizon to replace his phone by doing that.

Good luck
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
* bugreport filed - what now???
***************************************************************************

Big disclaimer, the following instructions are NOT recommended by the Google engineers.  There recommendation is to do a factory reset.  The following procedures might clear up the problem without doing a factory reset.  But they also might disable your phone to the point where you will have to do a factory reset to recover it.  To my mind, it isn't much of a risk, especially since Google seems to be in no hurry come up with a better fix.

I haven't run a Gingerbread phone for a while.  If I remember correctly, you go into the main Android settinsg menu and select
Applications > Manage Applications
and display the "All" tab.

Scroll down this list until you find Google Service Frameworks.  Select it and press the force stop, clear data, and clear cache buttons.  Then open Cadpage and try to register it with CodeMessaging again.  If it works, terrific.

If it doesn't, try restarting the phone.

If it still doesn't work, go back into the All Applications list and do the the Force Close, Clear Data, Clear Cache thing on
Google Service Frameworks
Google Play Service
Google Play Store
Power down your phone and then restart it
Open the Google Play Store and use it to browse a few things to see if it is working.  Open it's account setting and make sure you have an account selected.

Then try to register Cadpage with CodeMessaging again.

If it still doesn't work, you are down to doing a factory reset :(

So far, the factory reset has only failed to fix the problem one time.  And that user resolved the problem by getting Verizon to ship him a new phone.  If your problem persists after a factory reset, Google very much wants to talk to you.

Alternate solution I should have mentioned before, but in case I haven't

See if a system update is available for you phone.  From what I remember you get there by going back to Android Settings and selecting
About Phone > Software Update > Check for Updates.

If there is no system update available, and you got the phone from Verizon, you can try calling Verizon support and complaining that the phone can not be upgraded and the current software can not run critically needed software.  That is how my first user got Verizon to ship them a new phone.

Good luck,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

I just released a new v1.6.46 version of Cadpage which should be available on Google Play Store shortly.  It has some additional logging logic to record a whole bunch of information that I hope will be helpful to the Google people working on this.  I need you to trigger that log logic and send us the resulting file.  More specifically,

Make sure that you have v1.6.46 or later of Cadpage installed.

You will need to install some kind of file manager.  Astro file manager is highly recomended and has a useful free version.

Try, again, to register with Active911 direct paging again.  Since I haven't done anythin that might possibly fix things, this will, presumably, fail again.  This will trigger creation of a bugreport file, but the process takes a long time, give it a good 5  min before proceeding to the next step.

Use the Email the Developer setting to generate another email to us.  While this message is open, find a way to attach a file to it.  With Gmail, you would do this by pressing the menu button, attach a picture or video, then select the previously installed file manager to select the file.

In the file manager, navigate to the Download folder on your SD card.  Exactly where this is differs from phone to phone.  The SD card might be  mounted as /sdcard or /sdcard0 or /storage/sdcard0.  Where ever it is, it should have a Download folder, which hopefully will contain a file named bugreport.cadpage.gz.  Long press that file and select it, confirm that that file has been attached to your email and send it.

Good luck,
-Ken

* bad token abort
***************************************************************************

This used to be an annoying but uncommon problem that pops up when
Cadpage tries to display a dialog box about the same time that you close
the parent window.  I thought I had found and fixed all of the code
where this could potentially happen, but I must have missed something.
Do you recall just what it was you were doing when this crash happened?

Thanks for reporting this,
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* Receiving CodeMessaging text pages
***************************************************************************

Short answer: you are getting text pages from CodeMessaging and probably want to switch that to getting direct pages.

To do that, go into Cadpage Settings and select
Direct paging Vendors > CodeMessaging.net > Register
and follow the directions.

Long technical answer:  CodeMessaging has been switching to a new model where they run the Cadpage text parsers on their servers and send the page information in a standard Cadpage defined page format that is in no way related to the page format dispatch uses to send the original page information.  If you try to process their text pages using the standard Harford, MD location, it will not work.  That location code expects the pages to be formated the way Harford dispatch sends them, which is no longer the case.  It will work if you go into Location Settings and set the location to 
Select Single Location > General Location > Standard Cadpage Format A

But, life gets so much simpler for all concerned if you switch to using direct paging, which handles all of these details.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Handcent is the culprit.  They insist on being the top dog in the SMS queue, meaning they control whether Cadpage gets to see SMS text pages rather than the other way around.

Actually it is more complicated that that.  Cadpage, Handcent, and Go SMS are all fighting for the top slot, and the Android system awards that prize to the one that was installed first.  So you will find it starts working when you install a new version of Handcent, and stops working when you install a new version of Cadpage.  Which always makes it look like our Cadpage update broke things.

So what can you do, there are a few choices:
1) The latest version of Handcent has a new option to lower the input priority.  Presumably this will make it compatible with Cadpage, but this has not been conclusively confirmed.To get to it, select
   Menu > Settings > Application Settings > Lower Priority
2) You can uninstall Handcent and look for another messaging app, preferably after sending them a polite note telling them you won't put up with apps that don't play nicely with Cadpage.
3) You use the Handcent settings to blacklist the email/phone number dispatch uses to send you pages.  Then it nicely drops those calls back to Cadpage.
4) You can go to our download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/ where we keep the most recent version of Handcent that plays nicely with Cadpage.  Install that and things should work nicely.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

OK, let's try this:  Go to Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then Recalculate Payment Status, then immediately scroll to the bottom of the menu and select Email the Developer to send us an email from Cadpage.

This will send us an email to confirm what your Cadpage User email address is, as well as lots of other information to help us solve this.

******************************************************************

Direct paging is a cool feature that lets selected messaging services push CAD pages to Cadpage without using SMS text messaging.
Which means,
1) No SMS text message charges
2) No SMS text message size limits
3) It works on Android tablets

It only works if you are getting messages from a cooperating message service, which currently means either CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com.  CodeMessaging will only work with departments. Active911 works for departments or individuals.

Cadpage does not expect subscription payments if you are registered to get direct pages from one of these agencies.  We get part of they money you pay them.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
Active911 explanation
******************************************************************

Active911 is a messaging service that can push pages from dispatch to cell phones.  If you use a plain cell phone, Active911 uses text messaging.  If you use Cadpage or an iphone, Active911 can push pages without using text messages.

******************************************************************

You or your department have apparently paid for Active911, but you need to re-register your phone with Active911 to enable direct paging. 

Here are the details. If you have your activation code of letters and numbers, jump to step 3 below.

1. First, do you have an account with Active911?  If not, you should contact them about getting set up.  You can do that by visiting their web page at Active911.com.  Click the contact link, then the "click here to sign up online" link in the right sidebar.

2. If someone already set up a device for you, they should give you the device number and activation code you will need.  If you do not have that, Go to their website and open the Member Access page.  Then select the correct department and open the Devices tab.  If there is a device entry for you, it will show the required device number and activation code.  If not, it should tell you who to contact to set one up.  The device type needs to be set to Smartphone and the Page Type to "Cadpage Direct (Android)"  Make a note of the Device Key (or Access Code) associated with the device.

3. Next open the Cadpage settings on your phone.  Select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
This takes you to a web page where you need to enter the two part Device Key / Access code associated with the device.  If all goes well, Cadpage will display a notice that your Active911 direct paging connection has been activated.

At this point, Active911 will start sending you pages through the Internet data network instead of using SMS text pages.

Please let me know if you still have problems with Cadpage.

Good Luck,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************
** Already has activation code or switch to Android with Active911
******************************************************************

Your department has apparently paid for Active911, but you need to register your phone to enable direct paging with Cadpage.  

You will need the numeric device number and 4 character activation code associated with that device.  This is information you can obtain from your administrator, but let me know if you need assistance with that.

Next open the Cadpage settings on your phone.  Select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register

This takes you to a web page where you need to enter the two part Device Key / Access code associated with the device.  If all goes well, Cadpage will display a notice that your Active911 direct paging connection has been activated.

At this point, Active911 will start sending you pages through the Internet data network instead of using SMS text pages. 

Please let me know if you still have problems with Cadpage or the registration process.

If you have paid for a Cadpage subscription within the last 6 months, I can refund your payment.  With direct paging with Active911, Cadpage is free.

Good Luck, 
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin


******************************************************************
Trouble registering with Active911  phase 2
******************************************************************

Very occasionally, people are having trouble registering with
Active911.  There are a couple things you can try, usually something works.


*** For Android versions >= 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings
Scroll down to the Account settings and select Google
Verify that the Google Play account is syncing properly (ie.. that the last sync date/time is fairly recent)

*** For Android versions < 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings > Accounts & Sync > Google > Sync
and see if everything synchronizes.

Go into Cadpage Settings and select
Payment Status > I have an authorization code
and enter a code of "zapit".

Restart the device and try again.

This takes care of 95% of the reported problems.  If it does not there
are some odder tricks that are occasionally required.

Power down your device, remove the SD card, then power it up and
register Cadpage with Active911.  I have no idea why this would make any
difference, but it got one user up and running.

Double check your Active911 device configuration to confirm that it is
configured with a page type of Cadpage (Android).

Good luck,
-Ken

**********************************************************************

This could be one of two different problems.

1) the more common one is where your register Cadpage with Active911.  Active911 accepts the registration the confirmation never gets to Cadpage.  As a result, Cadpage does not show that you are registered with Active911 and your payment status does not give you credit for being sponsored by Active911, but you still receive direct pages from Active911.

2) Your Cadpage registration works successfully, Both Active911 and Cadpage report a fully activated status for a time.  But then something happens that unregistered your device on Active911, but not on Cadpage.

Which is your situation?

Good luck,
-Ken

**********************************************************************

Q:  I have been unable to get the key and activation code from my admin for
active 911 if you could help me I would greatly appreciate it.

A-- Alas, the Active911 support people have asked us not to do that as a
security precaution.  They want to make sure that anyone registering to
get their pages has department authorization to do so.  And we are not
in any position to validate that.

If you really cannot get the activation code from your admin you should
probably call the Active911 support line and ask them what you can do.

Good luck,
-Ken

Thanks for considering the purchase of a Cadpage subscription!

The usual, and preferred method of purchasing a Cadpage subscription is through the Google Play Store.  You do this by going into the Cadpage Settings and pressing
Payment Status > Purchase through Android Market.
Purchases made this way will update your payment status almost immediately.

If that does not work, the web page at 
http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments
has  instructions on how to make PayPal or Snail Mail payments

Basically, you can make out a check or money order to Cadpage and mail to:

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR 97370

If you do this, please include your Cadpage User email address (usually a gmail address) so I can make sure you get credit for it.

We would really love to have departments sponsor Cadpage for their members. We offer a 30% discount or more!  Details can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/other-support-options.

Also, if your department uses Active911 or CodeMessaging, then Cadpage is free if you use direct paging.

In the meantime, I can give you a 30-day extension.  To get that, go into the Cadpage settings, press the Payment Status item, then the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
DFNLNGAA or dfnlngaa.    It is a time-sensitive code, and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

******************************************************************

I cannot find a payment from you.  Under what name was the payment made?  Have you recently changed your email address?  

Is it possible that you or your department have paid for an account with Active911 or another messaging service?  Or perhaps you have paid for Cadpage For IOS.  We are separate companies.

It may not be necessary to locate that payment.  Go to Cadpage Settings and select Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status

If that does not work, try logging in to wallet.google.com or paypal.com.  From there you should be able to look up your Cadpage purchase and send us the date, time and transaction ID, and whether it was PayPal or Play Store.

Two different departments dispatched by the same center is easy.  You will get pages for both departments, but they both have to have the same text format, so Cadpage won't have any trouble handling both of them.

The reality is that maintaining and continually developing Cadpage is more than a full time job. We have to pay our bills somehow, and Google takes their fair share.

Most of our Users are volunteer firefighters or EMS workers.  My husband and I are both volunteers with our local fire department. Yes, it is unfortunate that we have to ask people already volunteering so much time and energy to pay us for a cool app.  The reality is that maintaining and continually developing Cadpage is more than a full time job.

Most of our Users are volunteer firefighters or EMS workers, so our policy for free subscriptions is based on hardship, not on being a volunteer.

$10 per year is way out of line for what you normally expect to pay for a general purpose Android app.  There are two reasons why this is necessary.
1) Cadpage is an extremely high maintenance app.  We put out weekly releases, and every week there are usually 10 or so location parsers that have to be fixed, either because Dispatch changed the text format, or because someone found a corner case that wasn't covered by the existing parser.  Most apps get by with a release every 3 months or more.
2) The potential user base is a tiny fraction of what a general purpose app can expect.  Cadpage is a niche market app, appealing to the small number of people who work or volunteer in emergency services.  The same development costs have to be spread among fewer people.

3) If you (or your department) are currently using CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as your messaging service, Cadpage is free when you use direct paging.

4) There is an old unsupported version of Cadpage available on the Cadpage download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage.  This version will not bug you about paying for it.

Purchases made this way will update your payment status almost immediately.

You can log into to wallet.google.com and see if they list a reason why things aren't working, like an expired credit card.

We also take PayPal & snail mail payments,   Details on how to do that can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments

Basically, you can make a check or money order payable to Cadpage and mail it to

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR 97370

If you do this, please include your Cadpage User email address (usually a gmail account) so I can make sure you get credit for it.

If you need a 30-day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
DFNLNGAA or dfnlngaa.  It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Thanks for your support,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

Try logging in to wallet.google.com and see if there is something that needs to be set up there.  If you don't have a wallet account, you may need to set one up.  If you have a wallet account set up with credit card or payment info, go back to your phone and open the Market app.  Then press
menu > accounts 
And make sure the account listed is the one you set up in wallet.google.com

Hopefully that will let you make Play Store purchases.  If it doesn't let us know and we will try to work something else out.

If you need a 30-day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
DFNLNGAA or dfnlngaa.  It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Thanks for your support,
-Ken

******************************************************************

If you can't map calls, Cadpage isn't really working and you shouldn't  have to pay for it.

So we need to fix things.  I can give you a 30-day extension to give us time to work on it.  To get this, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
DFNLNGAA or dfnlngaa.   It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ___.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.
 
Next, you need to send me the information on the calls that are not mapping.  You do this by long pressing the call and selecting Report Problem from the menu list.  That generates an email to us with lots of cool technical information needed to figure out what is wrong.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, go into Settings and press the Email the Developer settings as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message.  Which will hopefully be enough to help me figure out what is wrong.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

No problem. I have added your name and current User email address to a backup authorization server.  

Please try again:  Go into Settings, press Payment Status and then Recalculate Payment Status,

As always, please let us know of any further difficulties. 

Good Luck and thanks for your support,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

** Release info
******************************************************************
******************************************************************

This will be fixed in the next release.  

Weekly releases are generally published every Sunday evening.  If you want it earlier than that this should be in beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage tomorrow morning.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

This problem has been fixed in the beta release that you can install from  http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/

Sorry for the inconvenience,
-Ken

******************************************************************

This should be fixed in the current Cadpage release, which is available from Google Play Store.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

This is a sporadic but very frustrating problem with newer versions of the Android system that has been reported by many people and many different apps.  I implemented another round of published workarounds to see if I can resolve it in the next release.

The next release will probably be out next Thursday, but this fix is available in the beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage.  I would appreciate it if you could try installing that and see how things work with it.

Thanks,
-Ken

******************************************************************

This should be fixed in the latest release, now available on Play Store.

Thanks for reporting it,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Why do people have to pay for this
******************************************************************

You are going to have to install the regular Cadpage app first.  The free/no-support version doesn't have any of the support options you are going to need.

If you install the regular version of Cadpage, you have a 30 day evaluation period that you can use to work out whatever is going wrong.  If you're lucky, and it doesn't require any code changes, you can go back to using the free version when that 30 days is up.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

For the long story, see http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support.

Short answer,there are, and will always be, ways to run Cadpage without paying anything.

And, Cadpage is licensed under the GPL, which makes if free software in the "free speech" rather than "free beer" sense.  It allows anyone to copy the Cadpage source code and use it as the basis for their own product.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Locations
******************************************************************

You are still using the General location setting.  The general location doesn't really know anything about how your text messages are structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them.  To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to specify a location setting that will know more about your specific message format and can get a lot more information from it.

******************************************************************************

That's about as good as we can get with a generic location.  The generic parser has to process CAD pages of any format, and can only do this by making some very basic assumptions.  Assumptions that will frequently be wrong for specific locations.   You will get much better results by requesting a new location coded for your specific dispatch text format.

******************************************************************************

This isn't the text format we are expecting for <<LOCATION>>.  This happens all of the time and usually means you are dispatched from a different 911 center than we wrote this location for.  It just means we have to write a new location for you.

******************************************************************************

This isn't one of the many text formats we are expecting for Suffolk County.  Apparently dispatch changed the way page are sent and  we need to write a new parser for you.  

******************************************************************************
Details on setting up a new location
*****************************************************************

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to our main support address: support@cadpage.org.  If the messages are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and paste them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Good Luck and Thanks for your interest,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

*****************************************************************

OK, <<<>>> will be supported in the next release, probably next Sunday  If you want it earlier than that this should be in beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage tomorrow morning.

You are entitled to a free one year subscription for helping us set up a new location.  You just have to ask for it, preferably by using the Cadpage "Email the Developer" feature, so we know which account name has to be added to the subscription list.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

*****************************************************************

We are about ready to roll out an improved parser for you.  There are some mapping problems with some calls. Google could not locate any of the following.

If these address really exist, you can report them to Google as a mapping problem.  Find the correct location in maps.google.com, then click the Report a Problem link in the bottom right hand corner.  I pick Road/Street > Other road/street/path problem, then type in the search string and tell them that that search did not find this location.

If there is something we can change do a better job of finding the correct location, please let us know.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** DISPATCH FMT CHANGE?
******************************************************************

Hi folks,

We have gotten a report that the <<<<>>>> dispatch text pages are no longer working with Cadpage.  I need to know if they are still working for you.  If they are, I will need to retain the current functionality when I rewrite the text parser.  If not, can you report any examples of what your text pages look like now.  Just long  press all of the calls and select Report Problem to generate an email to us with information about the call.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

*****************************************************************
** General problems
******************************************************************

When a call comes in as an SMS text page, and Cadpage doesn't do anything to it, it automatically appears in the messaging inbox.  So if you don't want non-CAD pages to be handled as general alerts, we just don't do anything.

Direct paging is different.  If Cadpage doesn't handle them, they just disappear.  Since this seemed like an undesirable outcome, Cadpage always handles a direct page message.  If it isn't a real CAD page it will be treated as  a general alert, regardless of the process General Alert setting.   However, many people are, like yourself, unhappy with this state of affairs.  But we aren't sure what to do about it.

CodeMessaging is going to try to give users more options about whether non-page calls are sent to you or not.  But this really doesn't solve the problem, does it.

It would be easy enough to have Cadpage honor the process general alert setting for direct pages.  But as I explained, they will not show in you message inbox if we do this, they will completely disappear.  Is this what you would prefer?

In theory, I could turn the request into something that looks like an SMS text message and pass it to the messaging app.  This is a lot harder job that reading SMS messages.  To create them I have to get a lot of things  right.  But it probably could be done, and probably is the best solution to this particular problem.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** text page information is truncated
******************************************************************

Not much we can do about that.  All network carriers have limits how long an SMS text message can be.  If dispatch tries to send you something longer than that, it gets truncated.  There are things the message sending service can do to get around that.  But nothing we can do on the receiving end.

The only thing you can do is switch to a different message sending service.  Two in particular, CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com, can send pages through the the data networks, bypassing SMS text message limits altogether.

Good luck
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* Reports of general direct paging deliver failures
******************************************************************

That has been in infrequent but persistent problem with direct page ever since we implemented it.  I keep adding new workarounds to avoid the issue.  While none of them can be considered a real fix, they appear to have reduced the problem substantially.

One new development is that I now have a Google engineer who wants to help troubleshoot the problem.  What he needs is a hard example of a page that was picked up by Active911 but never received, or received after a long delay, by your device.  If have an incident where that  happens, look up the alert ID in the Active911 web page for your department and use the Email the Developer setting in Cadpage to send it to us.

My various workarounds have reduced the problem incidence rate to such an extent that I have having a hard time getting a user to report an actual delivery failure.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* Cadpage is not registered with Active911
* Registration ID is not null 
* Swift shows correct page type and registration ID
******************************************************************

Very occasionally, people are having trouble registering with
Active911.  There are a couple things you can try, usually something works.


*** For Android versions >= 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings
Scroll down to the Account settings and select Google
Verify that the Google Play account is syncing properly (ie.. that the last sync date/time is fairly recent)

*** For Android versions < 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings > Accounts & Sync > Google > Sync
and see if everything synchronizes.

Go into Cadpage Settings and select
Payment Status > I have an authorization code
and enter a code of "zapit".

Restart the device and try again.

This takes care of 95% of the reported problems.  If it does not there
are some odder tricks that are occasionally required.

Power down your device, remove the SD card, then power it up and
register Cadpage with Active911.  I have no idea why this would make any
difference, but it got one user up and running.

Good luck,
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* Active911 user not receiving pages
* Cadpage shows it is registered with Active911 
* Swift shows correct page type and registration ID
******************************************************************

First, get whoever sets up your device with Active911 to use the Active911 web page to send a test message to your phone.  

If you do get the test page, but still do not receive real dispatch alerts, then something about your Active911 settings is preventing them from sending dispatch pages to you.  If your department Active911 administrator cannot figure out what that is, try contacting Active911 support for help.

If the test message does not arrive in a timely manner, you have probably tripped over a problem with the underlying Google push protocol that we are trying to troubleshoot.  If you can send me the time you sent that test message that did not arrive, we can use that information to try and track down why it does not always work

Then, you can go into Cadpage settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct Paging
We do not know why, but doing this usually fixes the problem.

Good luck,
-Ken


******************************************************************
* Text paging delays 
******************************************************************

You are getting text pages, and the only reason Cadpage alerting will be delayed for text pages is because the messages are just not arriving at your device in a timely fashion.  If you want to prove this, go into Cadpage Additional Settings and check the box labeled "Pass Calls through to SMS Client".  With that set, all calls will be passed to your message inbox in addition to alerting Cadpage and you can confirm the extent to which the messages are delayed.

According to the message timestamps, it took only <*> seconds for the carrier to deliver this call to you, which would imply that the delay was introduced by the dispatch messaging service.  But this should not be considered hard proof, I have some suspicions that carriers are holding messages in a system queue for some reason and that the total delay is not represented by this number.

You can also try sending yourself text messages when these delays are observed to see if those messages are also being delayed.  But when it comes down to it, about the only thing you can really do is complain to the carrier and/or dispatch service about the delays.

It might be worth considering switching to another messaging service.  CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com are reasonably priced and can push pages to your device without relying on text messaging and will probably fix your delay problem.  Unless the dispatch center is slow getting the pages out, in which case they have logs to prove that and some clout to take the issue up with dispatch IT people.  And Cadpage doesn't bug you about paying for a subscription when you are getting direct pages from them.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Active911 registration issues
** Swift device has page type other than cadpage_c2dm
******************************************************************

Whoever set up your device in Active911, and gave you the device number and activation code to use, set it up with the wrong page type.  The page type should be "Cadpage (Android)".  They should be able to fix that.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Active911 or Codemessaging registration issues
** No recent registration errors
** Cadpage registation ID is non null
** Swift registration ID is null
******************************************************************

It looks like you have run into a new Google registration problem.  We are still trying to get a handle on how to deal with it.  Lacking any other great ideas at this point, can you try uninstalling and re-installing Cadpage.  That seems to have worked for at least one other user.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Recent PHONE_REGISTRATION_ERROR
** Null RegistrationID
** Cadpage version < 1.6.29
****************************************************************** 

Something has been going haywire with the Google infrastructure supporting direct paging some time ago.  It only impacts a small percentage of direct paging users, but that is small comfort to those who are impacted.  We have been complaining to Google but so far have not gotten any response.

The latest version of Cadpage has some new logic to help alleviate, but not completely eliminate, the problem.  Try installing that and see if that gets things working.

If it does not, use the Email the Developer feature to report the situation and we will see what we can do from there.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Recent PHONE_REGISTRATION_ERROR
** Null RegistrationID
** Cadpage version >= 1.6.29
******************************************************************
 
It looks like you are one of the users who cannot get the Google registration you need to implement direct paging.  Usually just retrying it a few times is enough to get things working.  But sometimes more serious measures are called for.

If you have not tried it yet, try uninstalling and re-installing Cadpage.  You will have to register your device with CodeMessaging or Active911 again, hoping it succeeds this time.

If that doesn't work, leave it and come back and try again in a couple hours.  It may just take some time to get Google's servers to respond to us.

If that does not work, we are starting to get desperate.  But first, double check that the account associated with Google Play Store is valid.  To do that, open the Play Store App and select
Menu > Accounts
and verify that the selected account is the one you expect.

*** For Android versions >= 4.0
Then go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings
Scroll down to the Account settings and select Google
Verify that the Google Play account is syncing properly (ie.. that the last sync date/time is fairly recent)

*** For Android versions < 4.0
Then go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings > Accounts & Sync > Google > Sync
and see if everything synchronizes.

Next, go back to Cadpage Settings and try to register with Active911/Code Messaging again.

If that does not work, we are down to recommending a factory reset.  This a rather drastic solution, but it has, thus far, always resolved this particular problem.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
* Duplicate pages with Active911
******************************************************************
Duplicate messages are fairly common for new Active911 users.   Some time back, you arranged to have text pages sent to your phone.  Those pages don't stop coming when you register with Active911.  As a result you always get two pages for each incident.

You have to talk to someone in your department about stopping the original text pages.  Probably the same person who got them sent to your phone in the first place.

Good luck,


******************************************************************

Your phone is running Android 2.1.  Direct Paging relies on a Google messaging service that is only supported for 2.2 and up.  

Your options are limited.  First check to see if your vendor has any system upgrades available
main > Menu > Settings > Software Update > Check New
and try installing them.

If there are no updates available, your only option is to get a new phone, or root the existing phone and install your own OS.  Directions for rooting most phones can be found on the Internet.  The process isn't nearly as dangerous as it sounds.  The important thing to make an NAND backup as soon as you have the recovery partition installed.  You can use that to restore the phone to pristine unrooted status if that becomes necessary.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
LATE PAGES:

If you can long press one of the calls you get and select Report Problem to send them to us, I could give you a better idea what is happening.  I need to see all of the alerts that are associated with one of your calls.

******************************************************************
** long list
******************************************************************

We have two different troubleshooting procedures. 

If you are getting direct pages from Active911 or CodeMessaging, you should contact us for the direct page troubleshooting list.

The following is a list for users who are getting regular text pages. This is a long list. Take it one step at a time. The important steps are the last two.  They send us information about your text pages so we can figure out what is wrong.

Are you getting text pages from your dispatch center?  CadPage works by processing those text messages, if you have not arranged to have them sent to your device, CadPage will not do anything for you.

Do you have Go SMS Pro or Handcent or AT&T Messenger installed?  They have proven to be incompatible with Cadpage. We keep the most recent version of Handcent that works with Cadpage on our Download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/

If you are getting messages going through to your messaging app, check to make sure that they are not MMS messages.  You do this by long pressing on one of the messages and selecting view message details.  This should tell you whether or not the message is an SMS text message or an MMS message.  If it is an MMS message, you have to to enable MMS message processing in the location settings.  But first read all of the warnings and disclaimers at http://www.cadpage.org/faq/mms-message-support.

Wait until the next text pages comes in.  If it still does not trigger CadPage, then use the Send Email to Developer feature to send us an email report.  This should include the most recently received text message, whether or not it was processed by CadPage, which gives us a lot of information we need to resolve the problem.

If the messages are triggering CADpage, but will not allow you to select map option: Long press the message to open the Options menu and select the "Report Problem" menu item.  This will generate an email containing all of the information we should need to track down the problem with this message.  You can get the same menu options from the call history screen by long pressing one of the call entries.

Good luck,
Jean -- Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************

We have two different long and involved trouble shooting procedures.  The following is a list for users who are getting regular text pages.

If you are getting direct pages from Active911 or CodeMessaging, you should contact us for the direct page troubleshooting list.

This is a partial list of what the problem might be.  If you need more help, please use the Cadpage app, and from Settings, select Email the Developer. We can gain lots of information from the data that comes with that message.

******************************************************************

This looks like a text pages from Active911.  We do not have a parser for Active911 text pages because Active911 generally only sends text pages to dumb cell phones.  For Android phones running Cadpage, you should register as a direct paging device.

First, either you or the person in your department who sets these things up should open the Active911 web site member access tab, switch to devices, and set your particular device up with a device type of Smartphone and a page type of Cadpage (Android).  There is a device key associated with your device that you will need for the next step.

Next, open Cadpage settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
Follow the directions which including entering the two part device key.  If all goes well, Active911 will accept your registration and send a confirmation to Cadpage, which will display a note saying you are now registered for direct pages.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

We need more information about your calls to figure out what is going wrong.

If you have calls that are not mapping, long press the call and select "Report Problem" from the option menu.  That generates an email to us with the info about the call.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, go into settings and press the Email the Developer setting as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message..

Good Luck,

-Ken

******************************************************************

Long press the call and select "Report Problem" from the option menu.  That generates an email to us with the info I need to figure out what is going wrong.

Have a nice day,

******************************************************************

Next problem.  Even with the fixed parser, this call isn't mapping because it looks for an address on 
SAW MILL RD
which Google doesn't find because it thinks the street name is
SAWMILL RD.

If Google has the incorrect name (it happens) you should report it to them as a problem.  Find the location in maps.google.com and click on the Report a Problem link in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  They will usually get it fixed in a month or so.

On the other hand, if Google has the correct name, let us know and we can change the page parser to rename that street name if it sees it again.

******************************************************************

This call parsed fine (with the fixed logic) but it isn't mapping.  Google can't find an address for
<<< LOCATION >>>

Does this address really exist? If it does, you short report this to Google as a search problem.  Just locate the correct location with a web browser using maps.google.com, click the Report a Problem link at the bottom right corner of the screen.  I click other for a type and tell them that the above search string did not find this address.

If Dispatch has the address wrong, or if there is something we can do to come up with a search string that will locate the correct address.  Let us know what it is and we will try to make that adjustment in Cadpage.

have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
* Alert tone cutting off after a second or two
* Android version >= 4.0
******************************************************************

I have had the problem sporadically on my phone, but never been able to nail done what makes it happen or not happen.

Searching the Internet came up with several references to the problem and a couple proposed solutions.  The one that is reported to consistently work is to open your message app, go into settings and turn "OFF" the "Delete old messages" setting.  Why this would affect Cadpage, especially when it is getting direct pages that have nothing to do with text messaging, is a complete mystery.

It has also been recommended that you turn off motion setting
To do that go bring up your System Settings and turn off the Motion menu in the System group.  That at least makes sense, though it isn't report to consistently fix the problem.

Please let me know if either of these fix your problem.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
*** Scanner setup

You have to set up some things before the Start Radio button will work

1) You have to install the Scanner Radio or Scanner Radio Pro app.

2) Open the Scanner Radio app and select one or more favorite channels that you want to listen to.

3) Then, open Cadpage Location Settings, scroll down to the bottom and use the Scanner Channel setting to select one of the Scanner Radio favorite channels.

4) If you want the channel to open automatically when a new call is received, check the box labeled "Auto Open Scanner Channel".

The Start Radio button should now launch the Scanner Radio app listening to the selected channel.

This doesn't magically turn your Android device into a shortwave radio receiver.  Scanner Radio works by relaying Internet feeds from volunteers across the country who have set up audio feeds from real hardware scanners.  If no one has set this up in your area your are out of luck.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
*** Scanner problems

Everything looks like it is set up correctly. Check to make sure that the scanner channel you are trying to active is still online.  If it is not, Scanner cannot play it.

If that isn't it, I need to see a copy of the system log recording one of these launch failures.  You can install any number of log viewing apps, I use Logcat myself, and use it to email a copy of the log to support@cadpage.org.  This needs to be done right after you get a call that fails to launch scanner radio.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
*** For NEW messages:

Cadpage will not do anything with your current settings.

The intended purpose of Cadpage is to support emergency responders who get text pages from a central dispatch center when they are asked to respond to an emergency.  Cadpage takes those pages, displays the information from them, and gives the user the option to bring up a Google map showing the location of the incident.Then they can ask for directions to that location.

First, make sure you are getting text pages sent to your phone when a call is toned out.  If you are not, talk to someone in your department about getting that set up.

Next, go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or work.  If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, please let us know if you would like the details of setting up a new location.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting.  Set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Please contact us again if you still have difficulties.

Go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and
then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or
work.  If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, please let us know if you would like the details of setting up a
new location.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting.  Set the From:
filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.
 That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are
waiting for full location support.

Please contact us again if you still have difficulties.  The best way to do this is use the Email the Developer item in the main settings menu.

Good luck,
-Ken

There are only two reasons why the Direct Paging Vendor menu will be grayed out.

The most likely, and most difficult to fix, is that direct paging is only supported in Android 2.2 and up.  If you phone is still running Andoroid 2.1, you need to either upgrade your phone system, or purchase a new phone.  Carriers are notoriously slow about providing upgrades for the phones they sell you.  If you can't get one through the normal channels, you may have to look into rooting the phone and installing your own Android system.

The second possible reason is that you installed and are running the free/no-support variant of Cadpage.  Direct paging is not supported by that variant.  If you are using it you will need to install the regular version of Cadpage.  You will not be expected to pay anything for it, Cadpage is free for user registered with Active911.

You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are displayed as yellow text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a (Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

Occasionally users end up with call history filled with unopened calls.  At which point Cadpage starts deleting calls as soon as you open them.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,

iphone options; also ipad?
******************************************************************

We deal with Cadpage, an exclusively Android app.  

There are two Cadpage-like solutions for iPhone, but both require that
you get your pages through either CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com.
The reason for this is the IOS environment does not allow normal apps to
intercept text messages like we do on Android phones, so we have to use
a messaging service that has some other way to push pages to the phone app.

There are 2 options I see for iPhone Users:

1.  Cadpage For IOS is on the market.  You can contact Jesse at  support@apprhythmia.com
However, you will still need a messaging service like Active911 or CodeMessaging for his app to work.

2.  If you sign up with Active911.com as your paging service, they have their own IPhone app that pretty much does what Cadpage does on Android phones.

Good luck,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

******************************************************************
Cadpage is exclusively for Android devices.  But we partner with Active911 and CodeMessaging, which are both messaging services and can handle iphones and ipads.  There is also a new company on the block, Cadpage For IOS,which delivers Cadpage-like services to iphones, and maybe to ipads. However, with Cadpage For IOS, you would still need a messaging service like Active911 or CodeMessaging. We are 4 separate companies.

Are you still with me?

If you pay for a subscription with Active911 (for individuals or departments) or CodeMessaging (only departments), then Cadpage is free if you use direct paging.  Many departments are following this trend.  We at Cadpage help with writing parsers, so we get some payment from both services.  If your subscription is less than 6 months old, we would be happy to reimburse you.

Here are some contact email addresses for your further exploration:
Active911.com
CodeMessaging.net
Jesse at  support@apprhythmia.com is the developer of Cadpage For IOS

I hope that helps!
Take care!

Mapping from wrong system
******************************************************************

You have to uninstall (or just clear the defaults) for the mapping program that has been set as the default mapping app.

How you do this depends on the version of Android you have.  For ICS and above use
Main > Menu > Application Manager > (Wrong mapping app) > Clear Defaults

For Gingerbread and below it is
Main > Menu > Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > (Wrong mapping app) > Clear Defaults

Have a  nice day,

******************************************************************

Cadpage is an Android app that generally will not run on a PC system.  We do have some clever users that have gotten it running using the BlueStacks Android emulator.  Obviously the Windows hardware will receive text messages, so the pages have to be delivered through one of the two message services (CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com) that can push pages to Cadpage without using text messaging.

We don't officially support this, and it is a lot of work to set up.  But it can and has been done.

The old RingtonePickerActivity crash.  We see this every now and then.  Only with your specific model of phone and only with that particular version of the Android operating system.  A problem report has been opened for this
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15472
But nothing seems to be happening with it, unsurprising as developers aren't all that interested in things that only happen to a vendor specific and probably customized version of Android.

If you can get a Android upgrade from your vender, most people are on 2.2 by now, I would install that.  Otherwise you might want to consider rooting your phone and installing your own Android system.  Failing that, you will probably just have to live with this.

Good luck,

Basically, they have to find a way to send SMS text messages to individual mobile phones.  I've never been involved in that process.  It sounds like this may involve two or more parties with dispatch sending an email to one specific email address where some other agency takes charge to pushing it out to the mobile phones.

As for how the text message is formatted, we can work with just about anything, but we really like obvious delimiters between fields and consistent field usage.  Presumably they are using some kind of CAD software, and that will probably limit there message formatting options.

If they are entering free form text, I would recommend something like

call description; address; @place name; #apt; city; cross st 1; cross st 2; general info

Place name and apt are optional, you can skip them if they aren't needed.  We can tell if they are present or not by checking for a leading @ or #
Samples

STRUCTURE FILE; 322 N PINE ST; @MOTEL 6; #7; PORTLAND; 1ST AVE; 2ND AVE; SINGLE APT FIRE
GRASS FILE;124 E 16TH ST; CHICAGO; BROWN AVE;; ABOUT 50 FT DIAMETER

note that double semicolons are used to leave an empty field where there are less that two cross streets

Hope that helps,

******************************************************************

Unfortunately, this problem originates deep in the Android operating system.  Something that we, as application developers, cannot address directly.  All we can do is collect as much information as we can and report it as a problem on the Android forums and hope someone gets around to fixing it someday.  If we are real lucky, this experimenting might identify some configuration settings that triggers the crash, and that you can avoid by changing that setting.

Does it happen every time you get a CAD page, or only this particular message?  Does it happen when you get non-CAD pages?  How about when Cadpage notifications are disabled?  Or when SMS pass through to Messaging app is enabled?  How about when you use the test last message option in the location settings?

Something that would really help is to install an application viewer (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after a crash.

Good luck,

It is possible to past text from the search history into an email, it just isn't obvious.

1) Bring up the message display and map it.
2) Press the Map app search box or search button.  This brings up a list of past map search strings.  The one we want is at the top  of the screen.
3) Use the Trackball/optical mouse to select the top entry, which moves it into the search box.
4) Long press the search box.  When you get the long press menu select copy.
5) Next return to the Cadpage display dialog
6) Select menu then report problem
7) Leave both checkboxes checked and press Send
8) This puts you into the mail app with a prefilled message.  Long press the top of the message and select paste from the long press menu
9) Hopefully you just inserted the Map search string into the message.  Send the message.

* Emai support request
***************************************************************************

Not directly, for a variety of complicated technical reasons, Cadpage support for emailed alerts is just not going to happen.

There are indirect ways to make this happen.  The best is to sign up with the Active911.com messaging service.  They can take your email alerts and push them to Cadpage without relying on text messages, which avoids a lot of problems.

Alternatively, all cell network vendors maintain email address that will turn email into SMS or MMS text messages.  You can either forward or direct your email alerts to these addresses.

For Verizon, the email address are
NNNNNNNNNN@vtext.com for text messages and
NNNNNNNNNN@vzwpix.com for MMS messages

Other vendors have different gateway addresses.

Have a nice day,

***************************************************************************

Google navigation responds to navigate requests, which are different that map requests.  We could provide an option to have Cadpage send a navigate request instead of the map request, but have chosen not to for a couple reasons.

First it isn't necessary.  I takes you two taps to get from Google maps to Google navigation.  Tap the address bubble that displays on the map screen, then the directions button.  If you go into the Map app settings and select Labs, and then enable the Bubble Buttons feature, it will put a navigation button in the address bubble, saving you a keypress.

Second, Cadpage/Google Maps are good, but they are not perfect.  Occasionally Google Maps will find a completely totally wrong location, sometimes in the next state or county.  Having to go through the map app to get navigation directions gives the user a chance to eyeball the general location and observe that the mapped location is totally bogus.   If we let users jump directly into navigation, they might not figure out that the mapped location was wrong until they were halfway to the next county.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

The bad news is that Cadpage isn't going to work in your district.

Cadpage expects a text message from dispatch that contains all of the address and call information it needs to generate a map location.  Alas, your district looks like one of the old ones that can not or will not generate text messages when a call is dispatched.

The text messages you are getting aren't coming from Dispatch.  They are coming from a messaging service agency which has found a clever way to work around the dispatch center's failings.  They have some radio equipment in your area that listens for dispatch tones on the dispatch frequency, and saves the voice communication the immediately follows it.  This is uploaded to their server, which then generates the text  messages to everyone on the distribution list.  The text message gives users a link that user can click on which downloads the original voice message from the agency server and plays it.  Yours is a bit different in that they actually attach an audio file to the text message that contains the dispatch message.

It is a clever solution, but unfortunately not one that Cadpage can take advantage of.  To retrieve the call information, we would have to open the audio file ourselves and run it through a speach to text converter, then parse the result.  It would be an enourmous amount of work for what, we hope, will be  very small number of users.

Sorry for the bad news,
-Ken

You don't have to go back to text messages. All you have to do is stop installing new Cadpage releases.  You can run the current version of Cadpage forever, all it will do is display a modest red demo expired notice when time runs out.

And if you ever need something fixed sometime in the future, you can always pay something for it then.

Have a nice day,
-Ken


******************************************************************

As best we can tell, Oneida county sends dispatch alerts with line breaks between fields.  But at least one of the forwarding services they are using to convert those alerts into SMS text pages is stripping out the line breaks and leaving nothing to separate the data fields.  As a result, they all run together, and there is no way for use to accurately split them out again.

Some users, at some times, have gotten text messages with the line breaks intact.  Other users have gotten text messages with the line breaks have been replaced with '>' symbols.  Both of these can be handled.  But users who get text messages where the line breaks have been removed are SOL.

Someone needs to track down how these dispatch alerts get generated and talk someone into changing things.  If the unidentified forwarding service will either leave the line breaks in place, or replace them with something else, all will be well. If Dispatch can use some other character to separate data fields in the dispatch alerts, it won't matter what the forwarding service does with them.

Good luck,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

I'm trying to make enough from Cadpage users to keep making this my full time occupation.  I think this is in the users interest, if I can't do this and have to get a real paying job, Cadpage maintenance will decline dramatically.  And the way text formats change all over the time, that would make it unusable for large numbers of people.

I'm asking for $10/year, which isn't very much in terms of how much people usually pay just to have an Android phone.  But I'm also committed to making sure people who can not, or just will not, pay anything can continue to use it.

1) You can roll back to the v1.4.32 version has no real enforcement logic.  If the demo runs out it will just display a demo expired notice and go happily on its way.
2) If you run through the payment status menu, there is a "I can't afford $10" that gives you a chance to send us an email explaining why you can't pay that.  I'm pretty easy with these, as long as you don't insult me I'll probably give you a free 1 year subscription.
3) You can uninstall and reinstall Cadpage, which resets the 30 day demo clock.  You can do this as often as you want. Cadpage tries to make this easier by giving you a Reinstall Cadpage button when the demo expires.

It is also worth mentioning that Cadpage is distributed under an open source license.  Which makes it free software in the "Free Speech", rather than the "Free Beer" sense.  Anyone who doesn't like the way I am running things is free to take the source code and use it to create their own product.

Hope that makes sense.  If you have any better ideas on how we can keep Cadpage running, I would be happy to hear them.

***************************************************************************

OK, this is going to get a bit complicated.

You must be using the general location.  Current versions of Cadpage suspend the evaluation period while you are using the generic location, largely because performance and reliability are so poor and you aren't getting the full benefit of the Cadpage product.  That's what gives you the sponsored by Cadpage message.  If you had a recognized paid subscription along with the General location, it would have reported that.  But when you switched phones and lost the paid subscriber status, it started report the sponsored status rather start report you as having a limited time evaluation demo.

If you were using a supported location before the phone switch, just go into Location settings and select that location.  Then reload the payment status and all should be as it was.

If you were using the general location before the phone switch, there is no real problem, you can run Cadpage like this forever without it bugging you for more money.

Or you can go into Location settings and temporarily select a real location specific location.  That will put you back in demo mode, which will let you reload the payment status which should fix everything.  After which you can switch back to the general location.

But what we really want you to do is request a new location for your area.  That will probably be ready for the next release, and after you switch to that one location you can reload the payment status.

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to are main support address support@cadpage.org.  If they are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and past them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list and get it added.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the from: filter to whoever appears in the from: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Have a nice day,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

I do have concerns about using Cadpage as your primary navigation tool.  It is pretty good, but it is only as reliable as Google maps, and Google maps has some weaknesses.
1) It's ability to accurately find an address accurately goes down substantially in areas where it doesn't have access to property rolls.  Which appears to be the case for your area.
2) It can't find interchanges, overpasses, and mile markers.  This is principally a problem with limited access highways, which are, again, common in your district.
3) It won't tell you about special conditions, like bridge weight limits, that might be in your department map books.  You can remedy this one by setting up custom map layers.

I've been impressed with how well it works, and would actually consider using it as a primary navigation tool in districts like ours, where Google does have access to online property rolls and we have no limited access highways.  But unfortunately your district appears to lack those two conditions.

Still, Cadpage official policy disclaimer reads....

This application should NOT be used as a primary dispatch method. Neither the developers or Google will be responsible for sending you to the wrong address or mapping errors. It is your responsibility to determine if the address looks to be correct and to have an alternate means of verification. This is a supplemental aid only and can be wrong, fail to operate correctly, crash, or in some other way not work as intended which usually happens at the worst time possible. We try to make the app work in the best manner possible and to not crash and in general it should not attract hungry brown bears to your location. However there are no guarantees made.

Have a nice day,

I'm getting several complaints that notification sound doesn't work (unless the Notification Override is on)  Whis is very puzzling because I haven't changed anything about the notification logic for probably more than a year.

Of course, my sound plays with no problems whatsoever, which makes it hard to tell what is going wrong.

In the grasping at straws category, try cycling power on the device.  It's worked before for odd sound problems.

If that doesn't work, we're going to have to look at your system log.  Try installing a log view (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after you get a Cadpage alert.

Blackberry Users

Cadpage was developed as an Android app.  An IPhone version has recently been released, but that only happened because an IOS developer wanted to do it.

Thanks for your inquiry!

****************************************************************************

Sponsored Locations

An emergency dispatch center or a collection of departments served by that center can choose to sponsor the Cadpage location that services that center.  End users using only sponsored locations will not be expected to make any further financial contributions.

Department Sponsorship

This is more suited for single departments.  Each department is responsible for maintaining a list of the members they are sponsoring.  When the list changes, the entire list should be forwarded to the Cadpage support address and we will incorporate it into the next release.  Users on the sponsored list are considered to have a paid subscription for the year.  See Department Member List Format for the required list format.

Pricing

We expect payment of something like $5 / user for sponsored locations and $7/user for department sponsors.  But we aren't keeping track and will accept pretty much anything you decide to give us.  Prices may jump in future depending on events beyond our control, see Pricing Disclaimer.  Checks can be mailed to

******************************************************************************
** MMS throws security exception
******************************************************************************

This is a mystery....

The code Cadpage uses to handle MMS messages relies on some undocumented back door interfaces to the messaging system.  As of Jellybean (Android 4.1) we started seing this throw a security exception.  Which was unfortunate, but not completely surprising.  Of late, the situation has gotten more complicated.   Several users on JellyBean and higher versions of Android are running this with no problem.  And one user ran into this on Gingerbread (2.3) Android.

I am thinking it may have something to do with how security options are set, or which messaging app is handling the MMS messages.  If you can figure out what makes this stop and start happening we would be very very grateful.

The latest versions of Cadpage trap the abort.  So it won't crash on you.  But it probably won't work either.  If you really aren't receiving MMS pages, you can turn processing off by going into Location Settings and changing the Message Type Processed setting to something that does not include MMS messages.  Problem solved!!

If you are getting MMS pages, there are not many options.  The code in the new release might work, especially if you the message options set to download the data content automatically.  But we just don't know.  And I won't have time to investigate further options anytime soon.

You could revert back to the ICS version of Android where MMS logic seems to work.  Or you can sign up with the Active911.com message service.  They have a way of pushing long pages to Cadpage without relying on SMS or MMS messages.  Their fees are reasonable.  Cadpage gets a share of what they charge, so we don't except Cadpage users getting direct pages from Active911 to pay anything further.

Good luck,
-Ken

Dear ____ Department --

I have been doing some internal auditing of our Cadpage app and found that there is no record of your payment.  

I have the following members registered as Cadpage Users as of __________:

________
________

A Cadpage subscription is $10 per year, but department sponsorships are given a 30% discount.  Therefore this account would only amount to $21. I can prepare a more formal invoice at your request.  The subscription will expire on ______.

Please let me know if this is in error, or if you are having any problems with Cadpage.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

*************************************************************************

Does Cadpage require an active data connection?

Yes it does.  It needs either Internet connectivity or an active phone
connection to receive the dispatch pages in the first place.  And it
needs Internet connectivity to map the call locations.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

*************************************************************************

This used to be a common problem, one that we have never really gotten a good handle on.  But I haven't heard it reported for a good while, which makes me suspect (hope) that is limited to pre-ICS versions of Android.  If there is an Android system update available for your device, installing it may make this problem go away.

When you have the Override Notification setting checked, Cadpage skips the usual notification procedure and instead uses the Media Player to play are specific alert tone at full volume.  One some devices, the Media Player apparently cannot play our alert ringtone and Cadpage crashes.  Exactly why only those few devices are impacted remains a mystery.  The simple workaround is to turn off the Override Notification setting in Notification Settings.

Good luck,
-Ken

*************************************************************************
run Cadpage on cell and tablet?

You do not need an authorization code to run Cadpage anywhere.  If you
have a paid subscription for your cell phone, it will automatically carry
over to the tablet, or any other phone you have, as long as both devices
have configured Google Play Store to use the same email account.

If you are still having trouble, use the Email the Developer feature to
send us an email from both the phone and tablet.

Please note, while there is no problem at all running Cadpage on Android
tablets, you may have trouble getting pages to the tablet.  Most
Android tablets cannot receive SMS or MMS messages.  If you have one of
the lucky ones that do, life is good.  If not, the only way you can get
pages to the tablet is if you use CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as
your message service.

*******************************************************************
explanation of DEMO status vs PAID for length of time left

All is working as it should.  You have a paid subscription that will expire on 3/15/13.  But you reinstalled Cadpage on 1/27/13, and since then you have used only 5 days of the allotted 30 day evaluation period.  Cadpage does the math and figures your new evaluation period expires somewhere around 3/29/13.   Since you get more time as an evaluation demo that you do under the paid subscription, it reports the evaluation demo status.

The process isn't perfect, since you don't see the paid subscription expiration warning, you don't get informed that you can continue to run Cadpage beyond that date as long as you do not install a released published after that date.  But that still is an option.

Hope that all made sense, 
Ken

Cadpage does not have a filter that can select only fire calls.  If you

Sound problems == > Why is my alert sound only a couple seconds?

First, try restarting your phone.  That seems to fix most unexplained

If that does not fix things, try changing to a different notification
sound?  Possibly the one you have selected is only a few seconds long.

Does the vibrate option work as expected?

You can test the notification alert by going into Notification settings

> when are you going to get hydrant locations for Android?


Not anytime soon I fear.  There are some extremely difficult technical
issues that would need to be resolved.  And Cadpage probably isn't the
right place to implement such a thing.  You really want hydrant
information saved and maintained on some kind of central server where it
could be accessed by everyone in your department.  Keeping individual
phones updated with current data creates it's own set of problems.

I can think of two ways to get hydrant information into the map
displays.  The first would be to write your own Google custom map layer
and make it public.  The map layer could be automatically displayed when
Cadpage displays a map of your area.  The drawing tools supported by
Google are really crude.  You can't draw simple points for example.  I
did some experimenting and found that you can make a good approximation
of hydrant locations by drawing very small thick lines.

The second would be to switch to Active911.com for your message
servicing.  They do support custom map displays with hydrant locations.
 Unfortunately these would not show up in the Cadpage or Google map
displays.  You would have to use their IPhone app or display there
incident web page to see them.

Good luck,

Explanation of Cadpage For IOS, Active911 and CodeMEssaging

Caution!  An "earful" of information is about to be revealed!

Well, Cadpage For IOS is a different company run by a fellow named Jesse.  His contact email address is (support@apprhythmia.com).  It is an app for iphones, but to use it, you would need a messaging service like Active911 (Active911.com) or CodeMessaging (CodeMessaging.net).   These services push pages from dispatch to cell phones.  If you use a plain cell phone, they use text messaging.  If you use Cadpage or an iphone, they can push pages without using text messages.

We are Cadpage for Android phones, and have a deal with Active911 and CodeMessaging.  If you pay for one of those services, and use direct paging, then Cadpage is free.  Not so with Cadpage For IOS.  Jesse runs that separately.

Active911 is generally $12 per year, and deals with individuals as well as departments.  CodeMessaging is paid by departments, and starts at $29.99 per month.  Active911 also has an app for IOS devices to use in conjuction with the messaging service.  

In summary, your iphone User is on his own, unless your department switches to a messaging service as I have mentioned above. 

I hope this helps.  It has been an interesting time in this business!  We would be glad to help you if you decide to transition to Active911 or CodeMessaging, as we do get paid through them as well.

Thanks for your support and your inquiry.
Jean

So, here are the details in setting up the same email address for use on the second phone.

In your second phone, go to Android settings --- Accounts -- Add new account --- select Google --- existing --- email.

Enter your Cadpage User email address: 
nightrh@gmail.com

Then you may need to enter a password.

Please note that the instructions may vary a bit depending on the type of second phone you have.  

***************************************************************
fix this up?:

You might look into the FirefighterLog app.  It is published by somebody
else, but it will pick up the page information displayed by Cadpage and
will save it in a real database for long term retrieval and reporting
purposes.

Once you trial period expires, Cadpage will quit displaying call
details, which makes it more or less useless.  You are given options to
ask for another free day, I think you can do that 8 times.  Or to
reinstall Cadpage which will reset your demo period but loose all
Cadpage settings and history.

All you can do is select a different notification sound.  Different
notification sounds will play for different times.

At this point, it is not possible to select different notification
alerts for different departments.  A lot of people have requested that
and I hope to get it done someday, but it will not be any time soon.

Have a nice day,

I am responding
>   Is there a way to enable a button to auto dial Iamresponding?

If you want to report your responding status to IamResponding, you can
configure Cadpage to call the phone number that IamResponding give you.
 To do that, go into Cadpage settings and select
Additional Settings > Button Configuration > Response Button Menu
and set the Button 2 Phone/Code setting to the number you would like to
call.

If you want, you can get more complicated and set up multiple response
buttons with different titles calling different phone numbers.  If you
do, make sure you leave one button with no PhoneCode setting that you
can use to close the response button menu without calling anybody.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

**************************************************************

Q:> I want iamresponding to send texts through Cadpage instead of a sms on my

A: We would like very much to have IamResponding send direct pages to
Cadpage.  But that requires that IamResponding to spend some time
implementing the Cadpage direct paging interface.  And thus far, they
have expressed no interest in doing that.  Feel free to contact them
about your wishes.

Good luck,
-Ken


*******************************************************************
Q:
Cadpage started working after update but has stopped working again. Did they change things again?

Quite probably.  But I can't tell until I see what the pages look like now.

If Cadpage is still picking them up, you can long press the call and
select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  If Cadpage is not picking
up the call, using the Email the Developer feature right after Cadpage
fails to pick up a call will usually get it to us.

Good luck,
-Ken

Coding Parsers for Cadpage
Q: > I just wanted to let you know that I'm still interested in writing some

> What kind of source control do you use? Git? Mercurial? SVN? Darcs?

***

A: Cadpage is released under a GPLv3 license, the source code is hosted by Google Projects at https://code.google.com/p/cadpage/

We use a Subversion archive.  Outsourcing work is a new development for us, you would be the second developer we would have doing work for us, so the process is still new and experimental.  But it basically runs like this.

You check out the project source as an anonymous user.  The source tree consists of two Eclipse projects, one for the actual Android app and a second for all of the test classes.  What internal documentation we have is in the cadpage/docs directory.  There is a Getting_Started.txt file with the basic instructions to get things started.

A Parser assignment comes with a skeleton test class containing all of the sample text pages you need to process.  That will be found in the subversion archive.  You write a real parser to handle those pages, add the necessary test cases to the test class and check everything.  When you are done, you email me a patch file.  I apply the patch, check it out, and if everything looks good commit the changes to the archive and give you credit for implementing it.  You have to update your source tree from the archive on a regular basis, which picks up the new changes from your parsers and others.

There are a lot of tricks and underlying support infrastructure that is incredibly helpful but poorly documented.  We should schedule some time to get together and I can explain the basics and help you through the first couple parsers you write.  If you have a laptop you can bring it over to our house any time I'm home.  Otherwise we have found Skype screen sharing to be a helpful way I can check on how you are doing.

I'm going to be in panic mode until I get my taxes filed this week, but we can get together sometime next week if you are interested.

Have fun,
-Ken

A: The Map feature is the only thing that is really unique to Cadpage.  If
you are not using that then there are other, far cheaper, apps that will
monitor and alert you about incoming text messages.

If you do have any pages that are not mapping, long press the call and
select Report Problem to send it to us.  We will see what we can do with it.

If Cadpage fails to pick up something that you think it should, used the
Email the Developer feature to send us an email ASAP.  The generated
email includes technical information about the last text messages, which
I can hopefully use to identify why Cadpage did not pick it up.

A feature to allow alert notifications to be customized by a schedule or
by call type is one of the most often requested new features.  I really
hope to implement it someday, but just keeping up with text parsing is a
full time job that doesn't leave much time to work on new Cadpage
features.  We will probably get it done someday, but it isn't going to
be any time soon.  You might want to look into getting your pages
through Active911.com.  They do have scheduling and filtering
capabilities.  They only control whether or not you get pages, there
still is no way to customize different alerts for different pages, but
it might suit your needs.  Cadpage is free if you are getting pages from
Active911.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

****************************************************************************
Q:
> I do not have the ability to see other responders in real time. Is this a
> feature that is a available on the Android platform or only the iOS?
A:

Alas, that feature is only available for the Active911 IPhone app.  We are still trying to think of ways to implement that feature in Cadpage, but the technical challenges are formidable.

****************************************************************************
Q: Will not map the call when it comes across as a general alert

A: Could you please long press all of the calls reporting as general alerts
and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.

**************************************************************************
Q: > I am receiving pages well after the calls come out (30-60 min). I am not
> sure if it's a cadpage or dispatch problem but others that have the app
> are having the same problem.

A: This is being reported fairly often recently.  You are getting text
pages, and the only reason Cadpage alerting will be delayed for text
pages is because the messages are just not arriving at your device in a
timely fashion.  If you want to prove this, go into Cadpage Additional
Settings and check the box labeled "Pass Calls through to SMS Client".
With that set, all calls will be passed to your message inbox in
addition to alerting Cadpage and you can confirm the extent to which the
messages are delayed.

According to the message timestamps, it took a bit over 5 seconds for
the carrier to deliver this call to you, which would imply that the
delay was introduced by the dispatch messaging service.  But this should
not be considered hard proof, I have some suspicions that carriers are
holding messages in a system queue for some reason and that the total
delay is not represented by this number.

You can also try sending yourself text messages when these delays are
observed to see if those messages are also being delayed.  But when it
comes down to it, about the only thing you can really do is complain to
the carrier and/or dispatch service about the delays.

It might be worth considering switching to another messaging service.
CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com are reasonably priced and can push
pages to your device without relying on text messaging and will probably
fix your delay problem.  Unless the dispatch center is slow getting the
pages out, in which case they have logs to prove that and some clout to
take the issue up with dispatch IT people.  And Cadpage doesn't bug you
about paying for a subscription when you are getting direct pages from them.

Good luck,
-Ken

***************************************************************
* Delays receiving direct pages (Active911 or CodeMessaging)
***************************************************************
Go into Cadpage Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct Paging
That usually takes care of direct paging delays.  You, or the Active911 administrator for your department, can test this by logging in to the Active911 web site and sending yourself a test message.

Good luck,
-Ken
*************************************************************

Sorry, we do not support Windows phones.  If you know of a developer who
would like to port Cadpage to Windows phones, we would be happy to help
any way that we can.

**************************************************************

The basic problem is that all dispatch centers have a different way of
formatting their text pages.  Which a specific text parser has to be
written for each one.  Since this parser is dedicated to handling only
pages from this dispatch center, it can be very specific about pulling
the correct information out of each message.  The downside is that we
need a lot of these parsers, getting close to 800 now, and they have to
be continuously updated to keep up with changes dispatch centers make to
how the pages are formatted.  Which is what makes Cadpage such a high
maintenance (read expensive) app.

When we don't have a specific location parser to handle your pages, the
only way you can use Cadpage is with one of the general location
parsers.  These parsers don't know the specifics of the pages they have
to handle, so look at everything and make general informed guesses at
where the needed information can be found.  Because they lack this
specific knowledge, the won't always get the correct information, and
are more likely to fail completely that a location specific parser.
While the general parsers are large and complicated, some of my best
work really, they are rather static and almost never need to be updated.
 Because they are not as reliable as a location specific parser.  And
because their total maintenance costs are relatively low, we have chosen
to not try to collect from users until we have a location specific
parser they can use.

Hope that all makes sense,
-Ken

********************************************************************************
SPONSOR by Cadpage -- for General Location; foreign (non-Canada) locations

You may continue with the SPONSORed Cadpage by using the General location setting and set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages. 

*********************************************************************************
Well, when you go into Cadpage, you probably have a list of past calls, named Call History.

You can send us any number of these dispatch messages by long pressing the call from the Call History list.  Then select Report Problem from the menu list, and Email the Developer.  That generates an email to us with details of the call.

*******************************************************************************
Q:I gather that it is still filtering the
pages add they come into our phones but the location settings help parse
out and display the page properly. Am I reading that correctly?

A: The location setting only tells Cadpage how the expected text page is
formmatted so we know how to parse information from it.  Usually all of
the departments served by one dispatch center use the same text page
format, so the same location will work for all departments dispatched by
that center.  It is a common misconception that setting a particular
location is all that you have to do to start receiving pages from that
center.  As explaned before, it is the dispatch center/message service
that decides which pages will be sent to your device, the location just
tells Cadpage how to interpret those pages.

3) The map option not being available usually means I have to fix
something.  You need to long press all of the calls that are not mapping
and select "Report Problem" to generate an email to us with details
about that call.

Cadpage does not determine who sends you pages, that has to be arranged
with someone else.  The Cadpage location settings merely tell Cadpage
how to process pages that you have already arranged to have sent to your
phone.

If you are a member of a fire department or other emergency response
organization, there is someone in your department who can usually get
pages sent to your phone.  You just have to ask around to see who that
is.  If you are not a member of an emergency response organization,
Cadpage will be of little use to you.

Q:  I was wondering why their is only notification sounds that are the same notification sounds that are the default sounds of android phone whereas 
the iPhone has notifications that sound like a department pager etc that are through cad page 


A: Different environments.  From what I understand, the IOS environment forces developers to provide your own notification sounds and makes it difficult to use system sponsored oens.  The Android environment makes it difficult
 to provide your own notification sounds and easy to use the system predefined ones.  I was thinking of adding an option to install all of the Active911 notification sounds in the Android system where they would be available 
 to everyone.  But like so many other things I just don't have time to get to it.

You should find someone in your department to talk to about it.

Q:  Is there any way to make cadpage receive email pages?

A: Not directly, for a variety of complicated technical reasons, Cadpage
support for emailed alerts is just not going to happen.

There are indirect ways to make this happen.  The best is to sign up
with the Active911.com messaging service.  They can take your email
alerts and push them to Cadpage without relying on text messages, which
avoids a lot of problems.

Alternatively, all cell network vendors maintain email address that will
turn email into SMS or MMS text messages.  You can either forward or
direct your email alerts to these addresses.

For Verizon, the email address are
NNNNNNNNNN@vtext.com for text messages and
NNNNNNNNNN@vzwpix.com for MMS messages

Other vendors have different gateway addresses.

not refunding 

Please allow me to explain the fee for our Cadpage app.  Because it is a high maintenance app, continually in development, our $10 fee is a per-year subscription.  You have not purchased the app, but I did find your subscription payment as of 11-12-12.  You apparently used Cadpage for over 8 months.

Also, when you pay through Google Play Store, Google takes 30% of that $10. With Google, we cannot do partial refunds, so we would be losing out of most of our $7 gain. 

Therefore our policy is to refund subscriptions 6 months old or less. 
I regret to say that we will not refund your $10 payment, but if you are really in a hardship situation, please let us know.

Thanks for your support, and your understanding,

multiple departements or agencies

Cadpage can handle multiple departments easily enough.

If your departments support text pages, you have to make arrangements to have their text pages sent to your phone.  Then just select the appropriate location(s) in Cadpage to cover your text page department.

If your departments get pages through Active911, it is a simple matter to have your device added to the  device lists for both departments. 

Good luck,
Jean, Asssistant to Ken Corbin


***********************************************************************************
Explanation of CodeMessaging and Active911 

Cadpage, as a standalone app, has no addition features beyond what you
get during the evaluation demo.  And no additional costs beyond the
regular $10/year subscription fee.

If you use CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as your message forwarding
service, they will provide additional features.  Both can push pages to
Cadpage without relying on text messaging, which eliminates any text
message fees and length limits.  CodeMessaging will keep track of and
report responder status.  Active911 will track and report bot responder
status and position.  These are features which are really providing by
the forwarding service, but Cadpage supports their use.

Using either agency will allow your IPhone users to run Cadpage like
apps.  Restrictions imposed by the IOS system prevent IPhone apps from
intercepting text pages the way Cadpage/Android does.  The only way to
use a Cadpage like app on an IOS device is if one of those two services
can push pages to it.

And Cadpage itself is free if you are getting direct pages from either
service.

compare Active911 for iPhone and Android Cadpage

Cadpage/Android does not currently have the ability to display a map
showing the locations of other responders.  This is a known issue, we
are working with Active911 to resolve it somehow, but there are a lot of
technical issues that need to be solved.

That was, to my knowledge, the only feature of the Active911 IPhone app
that Cadpage/Android does not support.

********************************************************************************
General message about Android devices that support Cadpage


Cadpage works on pretty much all Android devices.  It can work with
pretty much all dispatch page messages, but supporting the requires some
work on both of our parts.

The free version of Cadpage lacks the support features needed to get
things working.  You will have to uninstall it and install the regular
Cadpage version from Google Play Store.  It does not cost anything to
install.  And it will run for 30 days before asking you to pay anything.
 And there are and always will be ways to continue running it
indefinitely without having to pay anything.

Once you have that set up, wait until you get some calls.  If Cadpage
picks up your calls, long press the call and select "Report Problem" to
send it to us.  If it does not, use the Email the Developer setting to
generate an email to us.  Either option should include information about
your current settings and the page message that I need to figure out
what needs to be done.

***********************************************************************************
Security issues

Cadpage does not do anything to determine what pages are sent to what
phones.  It only displays the page information that is sent to your
phone.  Dispatch or the messaging service that dispatch uses is
responsible for determining which pages are sent to where.

Usually you dispatch Admin or someone in your department is responsible
for maintaining a list of which phone numbers/devices should be sent
your department pages.  There are always some kind of security
provisions to ensure that that list can not be altered by unauthorized
persons.

Given that, there have been cases where unauthorized citizens have ended
up receiving department pages.  These fall into both categories, but
involve failures on the part of the department IT people.

1) There are one and possibly more individuals on the east coast who
have used good old fashioned social engineering tactics to convince the
device admins to add them to the department distribution lists.  There
need to be procedures and policies in place to confirm the identity of
anyone asking to be included in the dispatch page distribution list.

2) Occasionally, we here from unhappy private citizens who have just
gotten a new cell phone and are being sent dispatch alerts from some
unknown source.  What happens is someone who was initially authorized to
receive dispatch pages changed their cell phone number, and the old
number was eventually reassigned to a new user getting a new phone
number.  The device admins need to be careful about cleaning up the list
when members leave the department or change phone numbers.

****************************************************************************
General Help Message

I try really hard to avoid getting into phone support.  There are only
two of us working on Cadpage and it would take too much of my time.

Everything about your phone setup and the Active911 phone setup looks
fine.  If you are receiving Cadpage pages that are not right somehow,
long press them and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.

If you are not getting pages, get whoever sets up your device with
Active911 to use the Active911 web page to send a test message to your
phone.

If you do get the test page, but still do not receive real dispatch
alerts, then something about your Active911 settings is preventing them
from sending dispatch pages to you.  If your department Active911
administrator cannot figure out what that is, try contacting Active911
support for help.

If the test message does not arrive in a timely manner, go into Cadpage
settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct Paging
We do not know why, but doing this usually fixes the problem.

mile markers
Q: The app does not recognize this as mm 3.3. Is it possible to do so?

A: It would not help if we did.  We use Google to generate the maps, and
one thing Google does not understand is highway mile markers.

There is a solution.  If you can generate a table of GPS coordinates for
highway mile markers in your district, we can use that to map calls to
the  mile markers.  Ideally you should have two sets of coordinates for
each Interstate mile marker, one for eastbound and another for westbound
lanes.

**********************************************
Q:How do I register through I am responding?

A: We do not have any direct contacts with IamResponding.  Basically,
someone in your department arranges to have them forward dispatch pages
as text messages to your phone.  Once you are getting those text pages,
Cadpage can be configured to process them.  IamResponding has a feature
where you can indicate your responding status by phoning one or more
special phone numbers.  Cadpage can be configured to call those numbers
when you press a predefined response button.

Good luck,
-Ken

********************************************************
Q:How do you long press calls?

A: Long press is a techie term for basically touch and hold.

If you view the Cadpage call history screen, you can select and open any
call by just touching it.  If you touch an item and hold it for a second
or two, an option menu will pop up.  Report Problem is one of the
options.  Selecting it brings up a dialog box asking if you want to send
us an email.  Pressing the yes button fires off an email request to your
Email client to generate an email that will be prefilled with lots of
technical information about that call.

Hope that all makes sense
-Ken
*******************************************************************
Q The clear all button only clears one call at a time 9nly after you've selected it.

A: You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are
displayed in bold text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a
(Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

Occasionally users end up with call history filled with unopened calls.
 At which point Cadpage starts deleting calls as soon as you open them.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the
additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened
calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,
-Ken

*********************************************************************
Q: one department used Active911, another does not

A:It looks like you have an Active911 subscription sponsored by
Mooresville Rescue Squad Inc.  If you register Cadpage with the device
number and and activation code that they can provide, two things will happen
1) You will start getting direct pages for Mooresville Rescue
2) Cadpage will stop asking you to purchase a subscription

If you do not want to get pages from Mooresville Rescue, you can log in
to the Active911.com web site and set your duty status to off.  Cadpage
will remain free for use as long as it is registered with the Active911
agency.  It looks like that is a fringe benefit of working for
Mooorseville Rescue.

While you are at it, you could set up Active911 agencies for the two
volunteer departments.  If they have the capability of sending text
pages to you, they can just as easily send them through Active911.  That
would require two separate subscriptions with Active911 that might cost
more $$$.  Active911 has a free subscription status for low volume
volunteer departments, you would have to contact them for the details.

Hope that all makes sense,
-Ken

***********************************************************************
Messages coming in as General alerts

The means that the location parser you have selected is not recognizing
the message as a dispatch page.  If you long press some of the general
alerts you are getting and select "Report Problem" to send them to us,
we will see what we have to do to fix things.

Good luck,
-Ken
***********************************************************************
re=used phone number

Cadpage does send pages or messages to anyone.  The app we publish only
processes text pages from local emergency services that are sent to your
phone.

My guess is that you just got a new phone, or new phone number, and had
the bad luck to be assigned a phone number that is being sent dispatch
pages because it was previously assigned to a emergency dispatch
responder.  What you need to do is contact the agency that is sending
you those pages and ask them to stop.

If you recognize the dispatch addresses as local area addresses, the
agency you need to contact is your local fire department.  Just call
them and explain what is happening.  They will take you off their
distribution list pronto.

If you do not recognize the dispatch addresses, we may be able to help
you.  We do have an extensive collection of dispatch pages from across
the country.  If you forward a couple of them to us at
support@cadpage.org, we may be able to identify the agency that is
sending them.  If you do this, please include your name and/or email
address.  We sometimes have trouble matching forwarded texts messages
with your emails.

Good luck,
-Ken
*************************************************************************
download updates


Android app updates are done through the Goggle Play store.  If you wait
a day or so it will usually notify you when an update is avaiable, or
automatically  install it.

If you got into Cadpage Settings and click the "Write a Cadpage Review"
button, it will take to the Play Store page for Cadpage, where you can
install any available updates as well as write a Cadpage review.

***************************************************************************
BASIC INFO

In it's basic form, Cadpage intercepts SMS text messages sent to an
Android phone, determines if they look like pages from a CAD dispatch
system, and if so, parses the information from the text and displays it
in a standard form.  When requested, we use the incident address to
display the incident location on a  map, and from their users can
request navigation guidance to the incident.

Dispatch centers have been sending SMS text pages to emergency
responders for years.  They do so without any awareness that Cadpage is
out there trying to process their pages.  The short story is, if you can
configure your CAD system to send text messages to subscribers, or more
commonly to send an SMTP (email) message to a messaging service who will
forward the page information to subscribers, than your system will work
with Cadpage.

There are two messaging services (CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com)
that can push your page information to Cadpage without using relying on
text messages.  This is often more reliable, and avoids problems with
long pages getting truncated because they are over the maximum limit for
text messages.  Using one of these services also your users to run
Cadpage on Android tablets that cannot receive SMS text messages, or on
IOS devices where the environment does not permit apps to intercept text
messages.

Cadpage was designed to serve Fire, EMS, and Police responders, but it
can also be used for public service and utility crews.  Any operation
that sends text messages that contain some kind of response or service
address will probably find it useful.

Hope that is useful!  Feel free to contact us if you have any more
questions.

Have a nice day,
-Ken
*************************************************************************
Q: Can you do a test page some time today?

A: You, or your deparments Active911 administrator, and send yourself a
text page from the Active911 web.  Go to the member information area and
select the device tab.  Beside each configured device there is a row of
three icons.  The middle one is used to send that device a text message.

Good luck,
-Ken
**************************************************************************
Connect back to Cadpage with Active911

To reconnect Cadpage to Active911, you have to open the Cadpage Settings
and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
This brings up a web page where you have to enter your device number and
activation code which is ____________.

*************************************************************************

We distribute the Cadpage app for Android phones.  Active911 is a
different organization with their own support system.  It is Active911
that maintains and displays the responder and custom Map information.
That information is available on the Active911 IPhone app, and the new
Active911 Android app.  It is not and never has been available with our
Cadpage app.

Cadpage should allow you to map the location of your incidents, we just
can't add responder and hydrant locations to those maps.  If you are
getting pages that are not mapping correctly, long press them and select
"Report Problem" to send them to us.

**************************************************************************
Active911 Android app

Generally you need one Active911 device code per device.  That device can be used for either
Cadpage or Active911 apps on either Android or IOS phones.   But it can
only be used for one app/phone combination at a time.  Usually that is
enough, it was expected that users will user either Cadpage or Active911
apps on their phones, but not both.

You can switch the device code back and forth between the Active911 and
Cadpage apps at will.  To switch back to Cadpage, just register the
Cadpage with Active911 the way you originally did
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
and enter the device code which is 40882-QZRI.  To switch from Cadpage
back to Active911, open the Active911 app settings, and change the
device code to something invalid.  Then change it back to 40882-QZRI.

You can use one device code to receive pages from any number of
Active911 agencies.  If you are using the Cadpage app, you can also set
it up to receive text pages from other departments in addition to the
pages you get through Active911.

Does that cover what you need?
***************************************************************************
late calls

Can you long press some of the calls that are coming in late and select
"Report Problem" to send them to us?

***************************************************************************
switch to Active911 Android app

It looks like your device is registered to use the new Active911 Android app. Since that new system is in place, your pages will no longer be sent to the Cadpage app.

If you want to switch back to using Cadpage instead of the Active911 app, you need to re-register Cadpage with Active911.
To do that, go into Cadpage Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Unregister > Register
then enter your device code: ________________.

If things still do not work, or if generated test messages do not make
it to your device, use the Email the Developer feature to send us
another email.

Good luck,
Jean, Assistant to Ken Corbin

Other agency uses for Cadpage

Q:  Curious to know if Cadpage would work for my Police Department. I work for

> Any info you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
>
A: Cadpage will be useful for any organization or agency that can send text
messages containing some kind of incident address to its members
notifying them when some event happens.

Cadpage takes care of what happens when those text messages are received
on your phone.  You have to set up the messaging system that creates
those text messages.  This is not that hard to do.  There are a lot of
services that allow you to send one email to a specific address and have
it be relayed as text messages to a list of group subscribers.

In particular, there are two such services, Codemessaging.net and
Active911.com, that can push pages to Cadpage without relying on text
messages.  Which has some advantages such as allowing Cadpage to work on
Android tablets that can not process text messages.

Good luck,


**************************************************************************

Using Cadpage and Active911 is not an either/or proposition.  We
strongly encourage, and a lot of users are very happy, using the Cadpage
Android app with the Active911 message service.

Cadpage can receive what we call direct pages from Active911.  These are
pages delivered through the data comm networks, just like they are to
the Active911 Android app.  Or it can receive regular text pages which
are dispatch pages delivered as SMS text messages.  If you have Cadapge
set up to receive direct pages from Active911, or CodeMessaging.net,
then there is no charge for using Cadpage.

If you want to register Cadpage with Active911, go into Cadpage settings
and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.net > Register
That takes you to a web page where you have to enter the Active911
activation code, which in your case is ___________

************************************************************************
General Location

The general
location doesn't really know anything about how your text messages are
structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them.
 To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to specify a
location setting that will know more about your specific message format
and can get a lot more information from it.

*****************************************************************************
Installing updates

Most likely it was automatically installed already.  If not, you install
the update with Google Play Store.  Or go into Cadpage settings and
select "Write a Cadpage Review" which takes you directly to the Play
Store page where you can update Cadpage.

******************************************************************************

As of Android 4.4, Cadpage no longer has the ability to prevent text
pages from showing up in your default message app inbox.  That "feature"
was eliminated because it was being grossly abused by other third party
messaging apps.

Cadpage can still process incoming text pages and and show an alert when
they are recognized as dispatch pages.  If it is not doing that, then
something else has probably changed.  See if you can use this email the
developer feature to send us an email right after Cadpage fails to pick
up a page.

The above comments apply to dispatch alerts that are received as SMS
text messages.  The  most recent alert reported here was a direct page
from Active911 for Jackson County.  Direct pages are not SMS messages,
they are not affected by anything done in Android 4.4, and they can not
possibly appear in your SMS message inbox.  I'm not sure quite what your
situation is, are you receiving direct pages from one agency and text
pages from a different agency?

Good luck,

*******************************************************************************
Hi folks,

I just found out about your service from someone in Dare County, NC.
And I believe we can offer a service that you will find extremely useful.

From what I can tell, you receive dispatch pages from a variety of
dispatch centers running all kinds of different CAD software.  Your
technical people must already run into the unpleasant reality which is
that there is no standard message protocol among dispatch centers.
Pretty much every dispatch center has their own text page format, and
requires a dedicated message parser to extract the information you need
to report and map the incident location.

Cadpage is a fairly simple Android app that is designed to check
incoming text messages, identify dispatch page alerts, and parse the
call and address information from those alerts and use it to alert the
user, who can then request a map and directions to the incident
location.  We ran into the lack of dispatch notice standardization
problem 3 years ago.  We responded by constructing a library of over 800
dispatch page parsers to handle messages from dispatch centers all over
the country.  While that library is directly integrated with the Cadpage
app running on Android devices, it can also be run as a standalone Java
library on your servers.  And in that mode, it can be used to parse
pages from all of our currently supported dispatch centers.

The Cadpage parsing library is an open source project distributed under
a GPLv3 license.  We do not charge users for using the library.  We do
charge for ongoing maintenance.  And between keeping up with changes to
existing page formats and implementing new parsers as needed, there is a
awful lot of maintenance required.  But if you do you own maintenance,
using your own developers to keep up with the parser changes and new
parsers required for your customers, then you do not have to pay us
anything.  The "price" is that you are paying your developers to work on
a parsing library that can, and will, be shared with some of your
competitors.  But those competitors are in the same boat.

If your technical people are interested, the entire Cadpage project w/
source code is hosted at https://code.google.com/p/cadpage.

The GPLv3 license is a holdover from the days when we base the initial
Cadpage app on code from another GPLv3 licensed project.  It really
isn't appropriate for library running on a server, and there are plans
to change the project license to an LGPLv3 license, with the additional
restriction that users of the library are prohibited from pursuing any
kind of patent enforcement action against other library users.

If you are interested or have questions, you can contact me at this
email address.  Or call me at 541-231-2776.

Have fun,

*****************************************************************************


Prior Android 4.4, apps have the ability to register for SMS messages at
a higher than normal priority.  This lets them get a first look at SMS
pages and, if it turns out to be something they need to process, block
those messages from appearing in the default messaging app.  Cadpage has
made use of this capability, as have a number of security and theft
prevention apps.

Unfortunately, a number of third party messaging apps, Handcent and Go
SMS in particular, have misused this feature to grab the highest
possibly priority slot, intercept all text messages, and block them from
being received by competing messaging apps.  This has been a major
problem for Cadpage, and other messaging app developers which have been
pretty much forced to adopt the same practice in self defense.  The most
recent version of Google Hangouts has started doing this as well.

In Android 4.4, the rules all change to eliminate this nonsense.  The
user gets to specify one default messaging app, that app always gets the
text pages, and only that app has access to the message database and
only that app can send SMS messages.  Other apps, such as Cadpage, can
continue to receive SMS messages, but will no longer be able to block
them from going to any other apps.

The good news is that Cadpage will continue to function under Android
4.4.  The bad news is that we will no longer be able to block dispatch
pages from appearing in your default message inbox.  The best you can do
is use a blacklisting feature in the default message app to prevent
dispatch pages from appearing there.

And, of course, if Cadpage is getting direct pages from
Codemessaging.net or Active911.com, nothing will change.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

mapping problem

Q: When pressing map on the call notification the proper

A:  Can you long press any call that is not mapping properly and select
"report Problem" to send it to us?

Thanks,
