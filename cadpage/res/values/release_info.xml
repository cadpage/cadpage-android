v1.8.19\n
Added option to enable split message merge logic for direct paging.  This should almost never be
necessary.  Direct paging is triggered by SMTP messages for which there are no length restrictions, 
so it is never necessary to split long alerts into multiple messages.  Despite this, and everyone\'s
best efforts, some of the dispatch alerts going through Active911 continue to be broken up into 
multiple messages.  For departments suffering through this, turning on this option will be a big help.\n
