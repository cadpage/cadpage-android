Cadpage will default to using GPS coordinates to map locations for districts where
dispatch centers routinely supply GPS coordiantes for most calls.  This is a mixed 
blessing.  GPS mapped locations are more reliable but not always as accurate as calls
mapped by their street address.  There is a new GPS Mapping Option in Additional 
settings that can be used to override this default telling Cadpage to always use
stree address mapping or to use GPS coordiate mapping any time GPS coordiantes are 
available\n
