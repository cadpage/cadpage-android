What"'"s new in this release\n
\n
Welcome to a new year, time for a new version number update.\n
\n
Fixed new bug in the last release crashing Cadpage that crashed Cadpage when
multiple locations are configured and a text page isn"'"t accepted by any of them.\n
\n
New Locations:\n
Riverside County, CA\n
Somerset County, MD\n
\n
Location Parsing Fixes:\n
Weld County, CO\n
Porter County, IN\n
Prince George"'"s County\n
Livingston County, MI\n
Haywood County, NC\n
Erie County, PA\n
\n
General Fixes:\n
Sender address filter logic has been changed so that numeric filters must match 
the beginning of the sender phone number.  Filters containing non-numeric
characters can still match any part of the sender address.\n
\n
Fixed some serious problems with subscriptions expiring as soon as Cadpage is
reinstalled.  And different problems that disabled all of the safeties that
were designed to allow Cadpage to keep running when things screw up.
