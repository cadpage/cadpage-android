\n
What"'"s new in this release\n
\n
The way we calculate demo limits has changed (again).  Now you have the usual
30 day trial demo, but now Cadpage doesn"'"t count days where you only use the 
generic locations.  Enforcement logic for the demo expiration isn"'"t in this
release, but expect it in the next one.\n
\n
There is now a separate app that is a free version of Cadpage that does everything
the standard one does, except that there are only minimal support options, and
updates will published a lot less frequently.\n
