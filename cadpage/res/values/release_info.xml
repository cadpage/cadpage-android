Cadpage can now report your position to Active911 so that you show up on their response map.  Sorry, 
we can not display the cool maps that they show on IPhone devices.  We will not report your position 
unless you explicitly authorize this, and unless you have GPS location setting enabled.\n
\n
This feature requires a new Cadpage permision to read the device GPS location.\n
