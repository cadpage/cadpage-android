Major changes to the way the call detail buttons are configured and used\n
Buttons are no longer optional, you have to have them\n
You can configure up to 6 buttons
If a callback number is configured, you will first be given the choice of
Not Responding or Responding buttons.  If there is something for the Ack button 
to do, it will be shown by itself until you acknowledge the call.  Then you
get to the regular button menu, which no longer includes an Ack button\n
There is a new Close App button that closes both the call display and call
history windows\n
