What"'"s new in this release\n
Android market donations have been enabled!!!!!\n  This is probably the last 
version of Cadpage that will not get seriously annoyed if you run over the demo
expiration date.  If you really don"'"t want to support us financially, this
would be a good time to stop installing Cadpage updates.\n
