Coming soon.  Pages dispatched through CodeMessaging can be delivered without incurring
text messaging fees.  And received on Android tablets.  Stay tuned for further details\n
\n
What"'"s new in this release\n
\n
The way we calculate demo limits has changed (again).  Now you have the usual
30 day trial demo, but now Cadpage doesn"'"t count days where you only use the 
generic locations.\n
\n
If you run past a demo expiration, Cadpage won"'"t trigger on calls.  It will 
record them in history and let them fall through to your normal messaging app.\n
\n
There is now a separate app that is a free version of Cadpage that does everything
the standard one does, except that there are only minimal support options, and
updates will published a lot less frequently.\n
