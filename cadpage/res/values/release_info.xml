What"'"s new in this release\n
\n
If your text pages include the incident date/time, and the parser for that location
has been updated to parse them out, Cadpage will report that date/time instead of
the time the text page was received.  It will take us a while to retrofit this
capability in all of our current location parsers.  If we do not have it in yours,
let us know and we will make changing it a priority.\n
