We starting to look at ways Cadpage can receive alerts from pagers or mobile radios that can
connect to Android devices using Bluetooth or a USB cable.  If your department uses radios with 
this capability and you would like us to develop a Cadpage interface to them, we would like to
hear from you.  The best way to contact us is by using the "Email the Developer" setting in
Cadpage settings.\n
