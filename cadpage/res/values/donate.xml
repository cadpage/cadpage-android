    Our sincere apologies.  Cadpage tracks you by your Google Market account
    and you are running Android 1.6 which does not gives us the ability to 
    determine your Google Market account.  The good news is that you get a free
    ride as long as you are running Android 1.6.

    The Android Market app reports that in-app purchases are not supported.
    You may need to upgrade the Market app to the latest version.  Or you may
    need to give it a valid Google account (Select menu > Accounts in the Market
    app)

  <string name="donate_android_beta_text">
    For technical reasons, you cannot make Android Market purchases from a beta

    So, you are paying monthly charges for a smart phone, probably have a text
    package and data package on top of that, which runs to how much a month?  
    "And you can't afford $10/year to pay hard working developers to keep Cadpage"
    up and running?\n
    \n
    "Why not, we're suckers for a good story.  Tell us why you don't think"
    you can afford $10 and we will probably give you a free subscription.

    This will restart your 30 day demo period.  Bit it will also erase all app data,
