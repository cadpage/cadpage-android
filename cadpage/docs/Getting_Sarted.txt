Quick getting started instructions for new developers.

Things you will need to install
1) Eclipse can be found at http://eclipse.org.  You want the Eclipse IDE for Java developers
2) Eclipse may or may not come bundled with a Java SDK.  If it does not, you will have to install one from somewhere
3) Apache Ant, which you can get from http://ant.apache.org
4) The Android SDK, which you can get from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.

If you are just doing parsers, you won't be running much of the Android SDK, but you need the libraries to get project to compile.

The Cadpage project is hosted at http://code.google.com/p/cadpage/.  
The Source link will show you how to check out the source tree.  
The Issues link tracks all non-parser issues.  Parser issues are tracked separately.

Check out the main trunk source to a new local directory.
Open a command shell, switch to the local directory and enter
ant import
to import the test code
Import two new Eclipse projects, one for the cadpage directory and one for the cadpageTest directory.

You should now be able to compile and run the Cadpage app from the cadpage project.  And run the entire
Junit test suite in the cadpageTest project

So what is this import/export business all about.  The test project source lives in a standard src directory.
but this source contains thousands of sample 911 emergency pages of real calls to real emergencies at real 
addresses.  To keep those from showing up in standard Google searches, we do not commit this directory to 
the archive.  Instead we run it all through a rot13 cypher to a rot13-src directory which is committed to the
archive.  There are some Ant build files with targets to update these directories from the other.

import - copy any rot13-src changes to src
export - copy any src changes to rot13
stat   - perform an export followed by an svn stat.
update - perform an svn update followed by an import.
