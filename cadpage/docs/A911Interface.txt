Cadpage App to App communications

I have been experimenting, and documenting for users, how we can go about running
Cadpage and Active911 apps on the same device, with the same device authorization 
code.  Nothing tricky about it, basically we register the Active911 app with your
servers first.  Then register Cadpage.  The direct page sent from the servers
goes to Cadpage.  But when Active911 is launched, either manually or from Cadpage,
Active911 polls your servers for updated information.  This is working pretty
well with existing software, but there are some things that can be changed to
make it work better.

The only real problem, which I discovered last week, is that installing a new
version of the Active911 app reregisters with the server and switch direct 
paging back to the Active911 app.  This shouldn't have been a surprise, both
Android apps are required to register and send an updated registration ID to
the server when a new release is installed.  You had to put in some special server
logic to ensure that a Cadpage reregister request did not switch the page type 
when a new Cadpage release is installed.  Now we need something similar to
prevent a page type switch when a new Active911 release is installed.

The next Cadpage release adds a new parameter to the reregister request.  
userReq=Y indicates the user specifically requested Cadpage be reconnnected
to the Active911 servers, and that switching the page type would be an
appropriate action.
userReq=N indicates this is an automatically generated request when Google
sent us an updated registration ID for whatever reason.  If the device page
type is not currently set for c2dm_cadpage, the request should be ignored.

If there is no userReq parameter, you are getting the request from an older Cadpage 
release and have no idea why it is being sent.  It would be appropriate to
default to N processing.
