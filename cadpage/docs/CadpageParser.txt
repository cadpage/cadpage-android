Using the Cadpage Parser in a standalone server environment


The Cadpage Parser is distributed as the CadpageParser.jar file available from
http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage.  It is distributred under a GPL3 license, 
the source code is available from http://code.google.com/p/cadpage

It can be called directy from a Java program, but will most commonly be 
executed as a standalone process   You do have to have Java 1.5 or better
installed on your system.

The command to run the Cadpage parser is
java -jar CadpageParser.jar <arguments>

Once started it will read page message information from stdin and output the parsed 
results to stdout.  Anything displayed on stderr indicates a fatal error and should
be logged and reported to the developers.

Arguments can be one of
FLGS=<flags>
   Flags can be any combination of
   P - Preparse message to remove artifacts inserted by a upstream message
       service.  Should not be necessary if page is coming directly from 
       dispatch CAD software
   G - Messages should be parsed as general alerts if not recognized as CAD pages
   default value "G"
FMT=<format code>
   format code is the parser format code.  Default value - read from stdin
SUBJ=<message subject>
   message subject.  Default value - read from stdin
   
Any parameter value set to a dash (-) will be read from stdin for every message
to be parsed

The parser will start by optionially reading values for flags, format code, and 
message subject as separate lines from stdin.  It will then read any number of
lines of text message, which can be terminated by an
<*EOD*>
marker, or by a regular EOF on stdin.  Parser will terminate after parsing this
message if input was terminated by a regular EOF.

The subject and text information will be parsed according to the defined
format code and the results written to stdout terminated by a
<*EOD*>
marker.  If the parser fails to parse this text, it will output an immediate
<*EOD*>
marker


Example #1 - Parser dedicated to handling a single location, pages received
directly from dispatch.  Subject is first line of input

java -jar CadpageParser.jar FLGS= FMT=ORBentonCounty 
Corvallis Alert
INC: CODE 1 MEDICAL
ADD:1740 MAIN ST
APT:
CITY:PHILOMATH
X:N 17TH ST * N 18TH ST
MAP:540-365
CFS:0907010-119
DIS:PHILOMATH FIRE
<*EOD*>


Example #2 - Parser handles pages from multiple locations, pages may be received
from an upstream messaging service which has already attempted to embed the
message subject in the message text.  Format code is first line of input.  Subject
is the blank second line.  The actual message text starts with the S: line

java -jar CadpageParser.jar FLGS=P FMT=ORBentonCounty 
ORBentonCounty

S: Corvallis Alert
M: INC: CODE 1 MEDICAL
ADD:1740 MAIN ST
APT:
CITY:PHILOMATH
X:N 17TH ST * N 18TH ST
MAP:540-365
CFS:0907010-119
DIS:PHILOMATH FIRE
<*EOD*>


Example #3 - Parser is invoked once per text page, pages may be received
from an upstream messaging service which has already attempted to embed the
message subject in the message text. Input is terminated by a hard EOF

java -jar CadpageParser.jar FLGS=PG FMT=ORBentonCounty "SUBJ=Corvallis Alert" 
ORBentonCounty
INC: CODE 1 MEDICAL
ADD:1740 MAIN ST
APT:
CITY:PHILOMATH
X:N 17TH ST * N 18TH ST
MAP:540-365
CFS:0907010-119
DIS:PHILOMATH FIRE
