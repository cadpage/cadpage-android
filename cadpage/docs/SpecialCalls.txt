General Alert and Run Report call handing.

A run report is a message from dispatch that closes out a previously dispatched
call.  While not an absolute requirement, a call with time reports (dispatch time, 
en route time, arival time, returning time, etc...) is a pretty positive indication
that this message is a run report.

A general alert is more ambiguous.  Generally, any message that we can identify 
as coming from the dispatch center but cannot identify as a run report or dispatch
alert should be reported as a general alert.

The old way of handling these had a number of disadvantages.  Starting with the
next Cadpage update, a new MsgType enum has been added to the parsed data structures.
It defaults to PAGE which is correct for normal calls.  It should be set to
GEN_ALERT or RUN_REPORT to indicate a general alert or run report call.  All
of the other fields should be set to normally parsed values.  Any any data that
does not fit in other fields can be saved in the strSupp (INFO) field.

If a run report does have dispatch times, these should be formatted in the INFO 
field, one line per time entry, close to the beginning of the reported information.
