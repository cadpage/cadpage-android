How to write Cadpage Location parsers

Start by checking the text pages and making a determination as to which base 
parser you should use.

Search MsgFormats for anything that looks like this location text pages.
Pattern searches are your friend hear, learn how to use them.  If you find 
something that matches that is already based on one of the Dispatch parsers, 
you probably want to subclass this parser from the same base parser.

If you find a pattern match that isn't already based on a Dispatch parser, you 
should consider creating a new one that can be hold the common code needed to
process both locations and subclassing both location parsers from it. 

Otherwise, if the text pages consists of data fields separated by an obvious field 
delimiter, use subclass FieldProgramParser

Otherwise, if text pages contains fields that are separated by keywords with
trailing colons, subclass FieldProgramParser

Otherwise, if the text pages contain an address whose beginning and end cannot
be identified without having to understand what an address looks like, subclass
SmartAddressParser.

Otherwise, subclass SmsMsgParser
