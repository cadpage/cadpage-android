Cool features under consideration

*******************************************************************************
Where possible, Cadpage should show the reported incident time instead of the
time the page was received.
Implemented in 4 phases
1) Write infrastructer to parse date and time from text pages (done)
2) Write code to calculate incident date from parsed date/time and display that
   (mostly done)
3) Run through all of the documented messages format in msgFormat.txt and make
   that all of their parsers are handling the date/time fields.
   a) For classes derived from FieldProgramParser, this can be done by
      adding DATE or TIME fields, or having existing date/time fields extend
      DateFile, TimeField, or DateTime field instead of SkipField.
   b) Other classes just parse fields into data.strDate and  data.strTime
   c) Test classes are a trick.  Rather than modify all of the test cases that
      now parse date/time fields, I found it faster to delete all of the
      test cases, regenerate them, make sure the run successfully of course,
      and then compare the new code to the baseline to make sure that nothing 
      changed that we didn't want to change.
      Generating test cases is one of the tricks to speed up parser writing.  
      Most parser test clases can be run as standalone applications.  When run
      in this  mode, they read a list of test pages terminated by a blank line
      and output Java code to test that page.  Of course, the test alwasy works
      because it was build to test the current results, so you have to hand
      check the results, but it is a lot faster than building test casses 
      yourself.
4) For text formats that do not include the incident date or time, we can try
   to derive the incident date/time from the message send time.  This is a
   millasecond timer that is delivered with the message.  It's starting epoch
   is unknown, converting it to a Java Date will require some experimentation.
   And I've seen the send and receive times differ by an hour, which implies 
   there might b time zone issues that need to be resolved.  I'm thinking this
   phase will add to new config settings.  Once to turn on message time reporting,
   the default will be to report the message received time like we do now.  And
   another which will be clock adjustment that will be applied to the send time.
   We may get away with just making this an integer number of hours, or we might
   have to adjust by hours and minutes to make of for discrepancies between 
   different system clocks.

Two new call button requests
Close App - closes the entire Cadpage app
Raw Msg/Fmt Msg - toggles between current display and a raw mode display that
displays the text message as it was received.  Put subject in parenthesis in
front of the actual text body. 

We call them buttons, but it they are really menu items that users can configure
as buttons.  Guts of the item processing logic is in SmsMmsMessage.  There is
clever logic that lets us logic to set up either Buttons or menu items depending
on what is being set up.  You can figure it out.

One complication is that the Raw/Fmt toggle should be global toggle that applies
to all displays rather than a flag attached to an individual message.  Which
probably means it should be implemented as a preference so it retains its value
if the OS kills and restarts Cadpage.  Which gets is into ManagePreferences and
the somewhat unorthodox way that we handle preferences.         
*******************************************************************************
Issue #28.  Add some kind of feature to notify users when a new version 
of CadPage is available (Derrick)
*******************************************************************************
Toggle menu item that switches the popup display between the current formated
display and a raw unformatted message display.  Useful if user want to look for
information in the message that isn't picked up by our parsers.
*******************************************************************************
Add option to display phone numbers in the call description.  Very few formats
include callback phone numbers, and I'm not sure putting them on the display
screen is a good idea, but some users might want it.  Any phone number in the
call description should automatically convert to a link that initiates the 
phone call.
*******************************************************************************
Add some logic to identify repeat pages for same incident.  Usually this will
just replace the previous entry in the history list, but some parsers will
combine information from both calls.  (That last is harder that it sounds, we have
to keep information from the original message somewhere). 
*******************************************************************************
Set up a comprehensive test suite!!!!!
*******************************************************************************
Comprehensive user manual would be nice
