Cool features under consideration

*******************************************************************************
Issue #27.  Add preference config item for a phone number that will be autoamatically
dialed when user selects 'Ack' menu item.
*******************************************************************************
Issue #28.  Add some kind of feature to notify users when a new version 
of CadPage is available (Derrick)
*******************************************************************************
Complete implementation of smart address parser and use it to finish rest
of new district requests (Ken)
*******************************************************************************
Smarten up the preference menu list items so they display the selected value in
option summary.  Users can see what the value is without going into the list.  
The Button configuration items already do this, just a mater of creating a new
base class that supports that as a general feature.
*******************************************************************************
Toggle menu item that switches the popup display between the current formated
display and a raw unformatted message display.  Useful if user want to look for
information in the message that isn't picked up by our parsers.
*******************************************************************************
Add option to display phone numbers in the call description.  Very few formats
include callback phone numbers, and I'm not sure putting them on the display
screen is a good idea, but some users might want it.  Any phone number in the
call description should automatically convert to a link that initiates the 
phone call.
*******************************************************************************
Convert the current location list configuration item to a two stage tree where
users first specify a state and then a location within that state.  This is
going to be challenging.  Isn't really needed now, but as our supported location
list continues to expand, it is going to be absolutely necessary at some point.
*******************************************************************************
Add default mapping city and state config items.  Useful in cases where the
defaults supplied by the parser are inadequate.  This can help with small 
districts where the parser covers a lot of extra territory with many duplicate
addresses.  Amityville in particular.
*******************************************************************************
Reenable the Donate feature with Derricks new Paypal URL.
*******************************************************************************
Add some logic to identify repeat pages for same incident.  Usually this will
just replace the previous entry in the history list, but some parsers will
combine information from both calls.  (That last is harder that it sounds, we have
to keep information from the original message somewhere). 
*******************************************************************************
Set up a comprehensive test suite!!!!!
*******************************************************************************
Add supplemental information support for existing parsers where that information
is available.
*******************************************************************************
Comprehensive user manual would be nice
