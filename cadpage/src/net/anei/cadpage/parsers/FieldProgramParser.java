/**
 * This is a general purpose programmable field parser.  It can be used as a
 * base class for parser that have to process an array of fields that lack
 * keyword identifiers but which should appear in a particular order.  There
 * is a provision to allow the order to be adjusted to handle optional fields
 * that may or may not be present.
 * 
 * The field sequence program consists of one string with a number of field
 * terms separated by blanks.  Each field term consists of the following
 * 
 * 1) A field name, these will match the names used in parser testing classes
 *    Subclasses can override the default field processors, or add their own
 *    by overriding the getField() method
 *    
 * 2) An optional slash followed by one or more alphanumeric characters that
 *    can be used to designate special handling by this field processor.
 *    
 * 3) An optional exclamation point [!] which indicates that this field is
 *    required and the parse operation should fail if it runs out of data before
 *    this field is processed, or
 *    An optional percent sign [%] which indicates that this field is expected.
 *    A missing expected field will not cause the parse operation to fail, but
 *    it will cause Cadpage to wait for a second text message containing the
 *    rest of the CAD page
 *    
 * 4) An optional plus sign [+] which indicates that this field should repeat
 *    Indefinitely.  Typically this only be used for INFO fields
 *    
 * 5) An option question mark [?] which indicates that this field may not be
 *    present.  The question mark may or may not be followed by a trigger 
 *    character.  If there is a trigger character, the presence of this character
 *    in position one of the data field indicates that the field is present, otherwise
 *    this field term will be skipped and the next field term used to process
 *    the current data field.  If there is no trigger character the program
 *    will attempt to deduce whether the field exists or not by querying the
 *    field processor for this and possibly subsequent field terms 
 *    
 * Field Qualifiers
 *   All conditional fields
 *     Z - suppress condition checks.  This is useful is this fields condition
 *     check is less reliable than another field behind it
 *     
 *   Address fields
 *     y - parse -xx city convention
 *     i - implied intersection convention
 *     s - accept sloppy addresses
 *     S - Invoke smart parser logic, this is followed by some optional flag
 *         characters, followed by up two 3 field designation characters
 *         Flag characters
 *         0 - @ or AT can mark begining or end of address
 *         First field character determines what can come ahead of the address
 *         X - nothing
 *         C - call description (req)
 *         c - call description (opt)
 *         P - Place name (opt)
 *         p - place name (req)
 *         S - something we can skip (opt)
 *         s - something we can skip (req)
 *         Second field character determines what data comes after the address
 *         X - nothing
 *         C - call description
 *         P - place name
 *         S - something we can skip
 *         a - apartment
 *         U - unit
 *         N - name
 *         I - supplemental info
 *         x - cross streets
 *         Third field character determines what to do with a special field between 
 *         the regular address and the city field
 *         X - nothing
 *         P - place name
 *         S - something we can skip
 *         
 * SPECIAL FIELD NAMES
 * 
 * INTLS - operator initials, always skipped but will validated as 1-3 upper case letters
 * 
 * ADDRCITY - Address and City field separated by a comma.  Can take all ofthe
 * special field qualifiers that an address field can.
 * 
 * END - Does no processing, fails if not beyond the end of the data fields
 * 
 *    
 * The ugly details on optional fields
 * 
 * Some data fields (like ADDR, ID, and X) have internal logic
 * to make a decision as to whether a particular data field is valid or not.
 * For these, the ? qualifier just calls that fields validation logic and uses
 * that to determine whether or not the field is present.
 * 
 * Others, like PLACE and INFO, have no such logic.  Yet we can and often do
 * use the ? qualifier when the field may or may not be present.  In such cases
 * the program looks for the next field after the optional field that does have
 * validation logic and tries to process that field on the assumption that the
 * optional field is missing.  If the validation fails, it proceeds assuming
 * the optional field is present.  The exact logic on which fields to check and
 * in what order is made when the parser class is instantiated, the program
 * string you pass is compiled into a set of parse and validation steps which
 * can then be executed when a string needs to be parsed.
 * 
 * Conditional branches
 * 
 * Conditional branches are an advanced feature that can be incredibly
 * useful in certain cases.  If there is a point in your program where
 * different field patterns may be possible, they can be enclosed in
 * parenthesis and separated by pipe characters.  For example
 * 
 * CALL ADDR ( CITY STATE | MAP ) INFO+
 * 
 * All of the conditional branches in a group, except the last one, must have
 * contain a validatable field that will be used to determine if this is the
 * correct branch to process
 * 
 * Keyword tags
 * 
 * tagged field can be defined by prefixing the field term with a tag name and
 * a colon.  A tagged field term will only match a data field that starts with
 * that tag name and a colon.  Tagged and positional (untagged) fields can 
 * be intermixed.
 * 
 * A keyword tagged field can be declared optional, which determines what happens
 * when no matching data field is found.  Normal behavior is to assume that
 * the tagged data field exists somewhere beyond the end of the field and pretty
 * much terminates field processing.  The the tagged field is declared optional
 * with a ? qualifier and no matching data field is found, the tagged field is
 * simply ignored and processing picks up with the next field.
