I just put out yet another release to fix this.  Maybe this time it will work.

This is a problem migrating settings from previous versions.  Which I can't duplicate since I no longer have any devices that have those previous versions installed.  So I just have to fix it and let you guys find the problems :(

Thanks for all of your help with this,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Do you have Handcent installed.  Last week the published a release that locks out Cadpage :(

There is nothing we can do to fix this.  Handcent and Go SMS are both going out of there way to make sure that only their app has control over who gets the text messages.  And there isn't anything we can do except complain about it.

One of our users figured out you can continue to use Cadpage with Handcent if you blacklist the text pages in the Handcent app.  Just long press the Handcent thread and select Blacklist.  If you get pages from multiple sender numbers you will have to do this multiple times.  But the only alternative is uninstalling Handcent.

The last version of Handcent that will work with Cadpage is available on our download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/

Handcent does have a Issue Report and Suggestions feature.  From the main screen press menu > More > Issue Report & Suggestions.  The more people complain, the more likely they are to change things.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Something else you might be interested in.  There are two messaging services, CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com, that can push CAD pages to Cadpage through Internet networks without using SMS text messaging. Saves on text messaging fees, and isn't subject to the annoying size limitation on SMS text messages.  And they work with Android tablets.

And, in the not too distant future, we hope to roll out an IPhone version of Cadpage.  When we do, it will only work if you are getting pages from one of those two services.  Alas, the IPhone environment doesn't let us intercept text messages like we do with the Android Cadpage.

Just a FYI,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Direct paging is a cool feature that lets selected messaging services push CAD pages to Cadpage without using SMS text messaging.
Which means,
1) No SMS text message charges
2) No SMS text message size limits
3) It works on Android tablets

It only works if you are getting messages from a cooperating message service.  Active911.com just came onlline, CodeMessaging.net is next in line and should be online in a couple days.

If you are getting pages through CodeMessaging, just hang on, direct paging will be available soon.  If you aren't you can only get it if you or your department switch to using one of those two messaging services.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

** Paypal and user list
******************************************************************

Hi, can you tell us anything about yourself.

Why do you need a free subscription?  What do you think of the whole donation/subscription process?  Is there a better way to do this?

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

You need to use Cadpage to generate an Email to us.  The email account you sent this from probably isn't the one Cadpage will use to identify you, generating a email with Cadpage will include the account information we need to give you a free subscription.  Got into Cadpage settings, press Payment Status, then I can't afford $10.  And better include something to remind me why you need a free subscription.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Thanks for your support.

Unfortunately, your Paypal account is most likely not how Cadpage knows you.  It would be a good idea to run through the 
Payment status > I've made a Paypal Payment > Send Email 
sequence to send us an email with the correct account we need to register.

Your Payment status should change when you load the next Cadpage version.  You can temporarily disable the release checks until you can install the next version as follows:

Go into Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
GCWRJMBA or gcwrjmba

Thanks again for your support,
-Ken

*****************************************************************

We got it.

You've been added to a paid subscriber list that is distributed with the app.  Your Payment status will change automatically when you load the next Cadpage version.  To update it manually now 
Go to Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press then "Recalculate Payment Status"

Thanks for your support,
-Ken

******************************************************************

No problem.

You've been added to a paid subscriber list that is distributed with the app.  Your Payment status will change automatically when you load the next Cadpage version.  To update it manually now 
Go to Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press then "Recalculate Payment Status"

Nice reviews from free Cadpage subscribers are much appreciated to offset the negatives from users who don't think anyone should have to pay anything.  There is a item toward the bottom of the settings menu that get you started on writing a Cadpage review.

Thanks,
-Ken

******************************************************************

The usual, and preferred method of purchasing a Cadpage Subscription is through the Android Market.  You do this by going into the Cadpage Settings and pressing
Payment Status > Purchase through Android Market.
Purchases made this way will update your payment status almost immediately.

If that doesn't work, the web page at 
http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments
has  instructions on how to make Paypal or Snail Mail payments

Thank you very much,
-Ken

******************************************************************

You can mail a check or money order to

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR 97370

If you do this, please include your email address so I can make sure you get credit for it.

Thank you very much,
-Ken

******************************************************************

I can't find a payment from you in either Paypal or Android market.  Could it possibly have been made under a different name?

It may not be necessary to locate that payment.  Try going to Cadpage Settings and select
Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status
That will attempts t reload you payment status from information maintain on the Android Market or Paypal servers.  

If that doesn't work, try logging in to wallet.google.com or paypal.com.  From there you should be able to look up your Cadpage purchase and send us the date, time and transaction ID.

We are very grateful for all contributions and apologize for any complications,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Android payment issues
******************************************************************

Try going into settings, press Payment Status and the Recalculate Payment Status, This reloads your  payment status from the market which will usually fixes things.

If it doesn't you should double check that you have the same Android Market account that you did on the previous phone.  Open the Market app, press menu, then accounts to view and possibly change your market account, then try the reload payment status again.

If that fails, contact us again.  We have a couple other tricks up our sleeves.

Thank you for your support,
-Ken

*****************************************************************

Most of our users are volunteer firefighters.  I'm a volunteer.  Yes it sucks that we have to ask people already volunteering so much time and energy to pay us for a cool app.  But the reality is that maintaining Cadpage is a full time job and I have to pay my bills somehow.

We would really love to have departments sponsor Cadpage for their members.  But have no way of contacting them other then getting you guys to bring it up.  If you can talk them into it, they get a 30% discount.  Details can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/other-support-options

I can give you a 30 day extension while you work things out.  To get that, go into the Cadpage settings, press the Payment Status item, then the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
WVMJERFA or wvmjerfa

If that doesn't work, there are a  number of approved ways to run Cadpage without paying anything.
1) You  can ask for a free subscription.  Which is pretty much what you did here, but you have to include something about not being able to afford it.  Simply claiming that volunteers shouldn't have to pay anything gets you this very long explanation.
2) You can simply reinstall Cadpage every 30 days.
3) If you sign up with one of the two messaging services that provide direct paging services, Cadpage is free.  We get a share of the money they get from billing users or departments.
4) There is totally free (and totally unsupported) version of Cadpage distributed as a separate app.  If you  got Cadpage working without our assistance so far, there is a pretty good chance the free/unsupported version will work just fine for you.

Thanks for the feedback,
-Ken

******************************************************************

What kind of problem are you having with Android Market?

Sometimes you can log into to wallet.google.com and see if they list a reason why things aren't working, like a bad credit card or something.

We also take Paypal & snail mail payments, but it is a bit of a hassle for all parties, and a violation of Android Market application publisher standards, so we don't encourage it.  Details on how to do that can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments

If you need a 30 day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
WVMJERFA or wvmjerfa

Thanks for your support,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Try logging in to wallet.google.com and see if there is something that needs to be set up there.  If you don't have a wallet account, you may need to set one up.  If you have a wallet account set up with credit card or payment info, go back to your phone and open the Market app.  Then press
menu > accounts 
And make sure the account listed is the one you set up in wallet.google.com

Hopefully that will let you make Android Market purchases.  If it doesn't let us know and we will try to work something else out.

If you need a 30 day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
WVMJERFA or wvmjerfa

Thanks for your support,
-Ken

******************************************************************

If you can't map calls, Cadpage isn't really working and you shouldn't  have to pay for it.

So we need to fix things.  I can give you a 30 day extension to give us time to work on it.  To get this, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
WVMJERFA or wvmjerfa

Next, you need to send me the information on the calls that are not mapping.  You do this by long pressing the call and selecting Report Problem from the menu list.  That generates an email to us with lots of cool technical information I need to figure out what is wrong.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, got into settings and press the Email the Developer settings as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message.  Which will hopefully be enough to help me figure out what is wrong.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Go into Cadpage settings and press
Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status

That will reload your payment status from a backup authorization server.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Release info
******************************************************************
******************************************************************

This will be fixed in the next release.  

Weekly releases are generally published every Thursday evening.  If you want it earlier than that this should be in beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage tomorrow morning.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

This should be fixed in the latest release, now available on the Android Market.

Thanks for reporting it,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Why do people have to pay for this
******************************************************************

You are going to have to install the regular Cadpage app first.  The free/no-support version doesn't have any of the support options you are going to need.

If you install the regular version of Cadpage, you have a 30 day evaluation period that you can use to work out whatever is going wrong.  If you lucky, and it doesn't require any code changes, you can go back to using the free version when that 30 days is up.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

For the long story, see http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support.

Short answer,there are, and will always be, ways to run Cadpage without paying anything.

And, Cadpage is licensed under the GPL, which makes if free software in the "free speech" rather than "free beer" sense.  It allows anyone to copy the Cadpage source code and use it as the basis for their own product.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

It is kind of amusing that people think nothing of shelling out $50+ per month for a smartphone carrier plan, but balk at anything more than $2-3 for an app, no matter how useful it might be.

$10/year is way out of line for what you normally expect to pay for a general purpose Android apps.  There are two reasons why this is necessary.
1) Cadpage is an extremely high maintenance app.  We put out weekly releases, and every week there are usually 10 or so location parsers that have to be fixed, either because Dispatch changed the text format, or because someone found a corner case that wasn't covered by the existing parser.  Most apps get by with a release every 3 months or more.
2) The potential user base is a tiny fraction of what a general purpose app can expect.  Cadpage is a niche market app, appealing to the small number of people who work or volunteer in emergency services.  The same development costs have to be spread amount fewer people.

It turns out to be full time job.  I'm not getting rich doing this.  I do make more than I would working at McDonald's.  But not a lot more.

There are several ways of running Cadpage without having to pay anything.
1) If you (or your department) are currently using or can switch to using CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as your messaging service, Cadapge is free if you are using the direct messaging option.
2) I give out free subscriptions to people who claim they can't afford $10.  About 20% of my subscribed users have hardship subscriptions.
3) You can just reinstall Cadpage every 30 days
4) There is a totally free/not-supported version of Cadpage available as a separate app.  It never bugs you for money, but doesn't come with the excellent, and expensive, support provided for regular Cadapge.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Locations
******************************************************************

You are still using the General location setting.  The general location doesn't really know anything about how your text messages are structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them.  To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to specify a location setting that will know more about your specific message format and can get a lot more information from it.

******************************************************************************

That's about as good as we can get with a generic location.  Remember the generic parser has to process CAD pages of any format, and can only do this by making some very basic assumptions.  Assumptions that will frequently be wrong for specific locations.   You will get much better results by requesting a new location coded for your specific dispatch text format.

******************************************************************************

This isn't the right text format we are expecting for <<LOCATION>>.  This happens all of the time and usually means you are dispatched from a different 911 center than we wrote this location for.  It just means we have to write a new location for you.

******************************************************************************

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to are main support address support@cadpage.org.  If they are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and past them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list and get it added.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the from: filter to whoever appears in the from: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Have a nice day,
-Ken

*****************************************************************

OK, <<<>>> will be supported in the next release, probably Thursday  If you want it earlier than that this should be in beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage tomorrow morning.

You are entitled to a free one year subscription for helping us set up a new location.  You just have to ask for it, preferably by using the Cadpage email the developer feature, so we know which account name has to be added to the subscription list.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

*****************************************************************
** General problems
******************************************************************

When a call comes in as an SMS text page, and Cadpage doesn't do anything to it, it automatically appears in the messaging inbox.  So if you don't want non-CAD pages to be handled as general alerts, we just don't do anything.

Direct paging is different.  If Cadpage doesn't handle them, they just disappear.  Since this seemed like an undesirable outcome, Cadpage always handles a direct page message.  If it isn't a real CAD page it will be treated as  a general alert, regardless of the process General Alert setting.   However, many people are, like yourself, unhappy with this state of affairs.  But we aren't sure what to do about it.

Code Messaging is going to try to give users more options about whether non-page calls are sent to you or not.  But this really doesn't solve the problem, does it.

It would be easy enough to have Cadpage honor the process general alert setting for direct pages.  But as I explained, they will not show in you message inbox if we do this, they will completely disappear.  Is this what you would prefer?

In theory, I could turn the request into something that looks like an SMS text message and pass it to the messaging app.  This is a lot harder job that reading SMS messages.  To create them I have to get a lot of things  right.  But it probably could be done, and probably is the best solution to this particular problem.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

I have seen this behavior before.  It is rare but occasionally push pages are received 5 and in one case 10 minutest after they were sent.  My first thought was to blame occasion overloading of Google's servers.  But the more I think about it the less likely that sounds.  Google lives and dies by their servers, they are probably the most battle hardened, redundant, and best connected servers on the planet.

A more likely explanation is that you have the device configured to use a local wireless router.  And the ISP servicing your department had a momentary outage.  I do know that I have only observed those delays when traffic was being routed through my home router.  And that small departments can't always afford super reliable ISP's.

So I guess the first question is, were your devices linked through the Internet through a possibly unreliable ISP, or using the carrier mobile network in a possibly marginal cell reception area?  

The take home lesson is, direct paging depends on the on the reliability of the Internet connectivity to your device.  If local ISP is less than 100% reliable, you might be better off always using the mobile networks for you Internet connection.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

There have been infrequent reports of delayed pages using the new direct paging protocol.  We are still trying to get a handle on just what is going on.

Direct paging pushes data to your phone through regular Internet data connections instead SMS text messages.  Usually, this is a plus.  But there are situations where this can be problematic.  First, there are some global phone settings that put the phone into a battery saving sleep mode where a Internet push will not wake the phone up. In particular, if Background data is not enabled, direct pages will not be received until Cadpage is opened.  You can check that at
Menu > Settings > Accounts & sync > Background data
the checkbox *MUST* be checked.

In other cases, we suspect transient, or non-transient, disruptions in your local ISP service.  Thus far, delays only seem to happen when the phone is connected to a local wireless router connected to an ISP network with a less than rock solid connection history.  Delays have not been observed when the device is connected through he mobile carrier network.  At least not yet.

That is what we have figured out so far.  Any additional information about you current situation would be appreciated.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Bucks County, PA has problems!!!!

This is the weirdest one I've seen yet.  It seems that the original page was broken up into three pieces that were sent separately.  The but second piece appears to have gone out through a different service agency that the other two, because it has a different heading protocol and came from a different address.  This agency apparently broke it's piece of the page into two section, of which only the first arrived.

At this point, I think I'm going to declare your current message servicing process broken beyond my ability to fix with Cadpage.  And advise you to push to ether have it fixed or replaced.  This may be in the process of happening already, some of by Bucks County users have been switched to a new process that seems to work a lot better than what you are getting.   I had hoped that this was going to be an across the board change, but that clearly didn't happen.  Now the hope is that it is being rolled out on a district by district basis, and that everyone will eventually be switched to the new process.

If that proves not to be the case, I would seriously look into signing up Active911.com as your messaging service.  The folks running it are friends of mine, they have a clean process for turning an SMTP CAD feed into a direct page that can be sent to Cadpage without using SMS messaging, which nicely eliminates both the SMS text fees and size limitations.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Here is the long list of things to check when Cadpage isn't working.  The important steps are the last two.  They send us information about your text pages that we need to figure out what is wrong.

Do you have Handcent or Go SMS Pro installed?  Both have proven to be incompatible with Cadpage.  Handcent used to work up until their most recent release.  You can download the previous version from http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/

Are you getting text pages from your dispatch center?  CadPage works by processing those text messages, if you haven't arranged to have them sent to your device, CadPage won't do anything for you.

If you are getting messages going through to your messaging app, check to make sure that they are not MMS messages.  You do this by long pressing on one of the messages and selecting view message details.  This should tell you whether or not the message is an SMS text message or an MMS message.  If it is an MMS message, you have to to enable MMS message processing in the location settings.  But first read all of the warnings and disclaimers at http://www.cadpage.org/faq/mms-message-support.

Wait until the next text pages comes in.  If it still doesn't trigger CadPage, then use the send email to developer feature to send us an email report.  This should include the most recently received text message, whether or not it was processed by CadPage, which gives us a lot of information we need to resolve the problem.

If the messages  are triggering CADpage, but won't allow you to select map option.  Long press the message to open the options menu and select the "Report Problem" menu item.  This will generate an email containing all of the information we should need to track down the problem with this message.  You can get the same menu options from the call history screen by long pressing one of the call entries.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

I need more information about you calls to figure out what is going wrong.

If you have calls that are not mapping, long press the call and select "Report Problem" from the option menu.  That generates an email to us with the info about the call.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, got into settings and press the Email the Developer settings as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message..

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Long press the call and select "Report Problem" from the option menu.  That generates an email to us with the info I need to figure out what is going wrong.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Next problem.  Even with the fixed parser, this call isn't mapping because it looks for an address on 
SAW MILL RD
which Google doesn't find because it thinks the street name is
SAWMILL RD.

If Google has the incorrect name (it happens) you should report it to them as a problem.  Find the location in maps.google.com and click on the Report a Problem link in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  They will usually get it fixed in a month or so.

On the other hand, if Google has the correct name, let us know and we can change the page parser to rename that street name if it sees it again.

******************************************************************

This call parsed fine (with the fixed logic) but it isn't mapping.  Google can't find an address for
<<< LOCATION >>>

Does this address really exist? If it does, you short report this to Google as a search problem.  Just locate the correct location with a web browser using maps.google.com, click the Report a Problem link at the bottom right corner of the screen.  I click other for a type and tell them that the above search string did not find this address.

If Dispatch has the address wrong, or if there is something we can do to come up with a search string that will locate the correct address.  Let us know what it is and we will try to make that adjustment in Cadpage.

have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

The first step is to go into the location settings, select a single location, and then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live.  If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, then you can think about getting one set up, and using the generic location in the meantime. 

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to are main support address support@cadpage.org.  If they are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and past them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list and get it added.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the from: filter to whoever appears in the from: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are displayed in bold text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a (Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Two different Cadpage/IPhone apps should be available by the end of the month.  Only one will be called Cadpage, the other will be marketed as an Active911 client.

The catch is that the will not be able to pick up text messages due to restrictions imposed by the IOS environment.  Initially, they will only work if you are getting direct pages from the Active911.com messaging service.  The Cadpage/IPhone app is excepted to work with CodeMessaging.net in the near future.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

The ack button turns off any notification and reminders the app might be using to 
get your attention after a real call is received.  If you don't have any reminders running,
it really doesn't do anything.  But if have a very loud an obnoxious alert sound configured,
the ack button turns it off.

It isn't unique in this.  Pressing any button or menu item will turn off the notification alert.
But other buttons all have other side effects while the ack button doesn't do anything
but silence the alert.

If you have a very persistent set of reminders configured, or override the regular notice
which overrides your phones volume setting with a loud continuous alert tone, you 
will find the Ack button essential.  If not, then it is pretty much wasting space.   All of the 
buttons can be configured to anything you want, so you can configure button 1 to do 
something else.

We are rethinking the way that is implemented, it does seem like a waste to tie up
a valuable button slot for something that doesn't do anything special.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

You have to uninstall (or just clear the defaults)  for the mapping program that you accidental set as the default mapping app.

Main > Menu > Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > (Wrong mapping app) > Clear Defaults
should do it.

This is a known bug in Android 2.2, you can track its status at 
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=10238&can=1&q=ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException%20MotionEvent&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars

******************************************************************

The old RingtonePickerActivity crash.  We see this every now and then.  Only with your specific model of phone and only with that particular version of the Android operating system.  A problem report has been opened for this
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15472
But nothing seems to be happening with it, unsurprising as developers aren't all that interested in things that only happen to a vendor specific and probably customized version of Android.

If you can get a Android upgrade from your vender, most people are on 2.2 by now, I would install that.  Otherwise you might want to consider rooting your phone and installing your own Android system.  Failing that, you will probably just have to live with this.

Good luck,

******************************************************************

Basically, they have to find a way to send SMS text messages to individual mobile phones.  I've never been involved in that process.  It sounds like this may involve two or more parties with dispatch sending an email to one specific email address where some other agency takes charge to pushing it out to the mobile phones.

As for how the text message is formatted, we can work with just about anything, but we really like obvious delimiters between fields and consistent field usage.  Presumably they are using some kind of CAD software, and that will probably limit there message formatting options.

If they are entering free form text, I would recommend something like

call description; address; @place name; #apt; city; cross st 1; cross st 2; general info

Place name and apt are optional, you can skip them if they aren't needed.  We can tell if they are present or not by checking for a leading @ or #

Unfortunately, this problem originates deep in the Android operating system.  Something that we, as application developers, cannot address directly.  All we can do is collect as much information as we can and report it as a problem on the Android forums and hope someone gets around to fixing it someday.  If we are real lucky, this experimenting might identify some configuration settings that triggers the crash, and that you can avoid by changing that setting.

Does it happen every time you get a CAD page, or only this particular message?  Does it happen when you get non-CAD pages?  How about when Cadpage notifications are disabled?  Or when SMS pass through to Messaging app is enabled?  How about when you use the test last message option in the location settings?

Something that would really help is to install an application viewer (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after a crash.

Good luck,
-Ken

It is possible to past text from the search history into an email, it just isn't obvious.

1) Bring up the message display and map it.
2) Press the Map app search box or search button.  This brings up a list of past map search strings.  The one we want is at the top  of the screen.
3) Use the Trackball/optical mouse to select the top entry, which moves it into the search box.
4) Long press the search box.  When you get the long press menu select copy.
5) Next return to the Cadpage display dialog
6) Select menu then report problem
7) Leave both checkboxes checked and press Send
8) This puts you into the mail app with a prefilled message.  Long press the top of the message and select paste from the long press menu
9) Hopefully you just inserted the Map search string into the message.  Send the message.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

Not directly, for a variety of complicated technical reasons, Cadpage support for emailed alerts is just not going to happen.

There are indirect ways to make this happen.  The best is to sign up with the Active911.com messaging service.  They can take your email alerts and push them to Cadpage without relying on text messages, which avoids a lot of problems.

Alternatively, all cell network vendors maintain email address that will turn email into SMS or MMS text messages.  You can either forward or direct your email alerts to these addresses.

For Verizon, the email address are
NNNNNNNNNN@vtext.com for text messages and
NNNNNNNNNN@vzwpix.com for MMS messages

Other vendors have different gateway addresses.

Have a nice day,

Google navigation responds to navigate requests, which are different that map requests.  We could provide an option to have Cadpage send a navigate request instead of the map request, but have chosen not to for a couple reasons.

First it isn't necessary.  I takes you two taps to get from Google maps to Google navigation.  Tap the address bubble that displays on the map screen, then the directions button.  If you go into the Map app settings and select Labs, and then enable the Bubble Buttons feature, it will put a navigation button in the address bubble, saving you a keypress.

Second, Cadpage/Google Maps are good, but they are not perfect.  Occasionally Google Maps will find a completely totally wrong location, sometimes in the next state or county.  Having to go through the map app to get navigation directions gives the user a chance to eyeball the general location and observer that the mapped location is totally bogus.   If we let users jump directly into navigation, they might not figure out that the mapped location was wrong until they were halfway to the next county.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

The bad news is that Cadpage isn't going to work in your district.

Cadpage expects a text message from dispatch that contains all of the address and call information it needs to generate a map location.  Alas, your district looks like one of the old ones that can not or will not generate text messages when a call is dispatched.

The text messages you are getting aren't coming from Dispatch.  They are coming from a messaging service agency which has found a clever way to work around the dispatch center's failings.  They have some radio equipment in your area that listens for dispatch tones on the dispatch frequency, and saves the voice communication the immediately follows it.  This is uploaded to their server, which then generates the text  messages to everyone on the distribution list.  The text message gives users a link that user can click on which downloads the original voice message from the agency server and plays it.  Yours is a bit different in that they actually attach an audio file to the text message that contains the dispatch message.

It is a clever solution, but unfortunately not one that Cadpage can take advantage of.  To retrieve the call information, we would have to open the audio file ourselves and run it through a speach to text converter, then parse the result.  It would be an enourmous amount of work for what, we hope, will be  very small number of users.

Sorry for the bad news,
-Ken

Google can't find an address of  

If there really is such an address, you can report it as a mapping problem by finding the correct location in Google maps and clicking the "Report a Problem" link in the lower right hand corner.

If there is something we can do to tweak the address that would help Google find it, let us know what that might be.

Have a nice day,

$10/year is way out of line for what you normally expect to pay for a general purpose Android apps.  There are two reasons why this is necessary.
1) Cadpage is an extremely high maintenance app.  We put out weekly releases, and every week there are usually 10 or so location parsers that have to be fixed, either because Dispatch changed the text format, or because someone found a corner case that wasn't covered by the existing parser.  Most apps get by with a release every 3 months or more.
2) The potential user base is a tiny fraction of what a general purpose app can expect.  Cadpage is a niche market app, appealing to the small number of people who work or volunteer in emergency services.  The same development costs have to be spread amount fewer people.

******************************************************************

I also volunteer with my local FD, spending a lot of time and getting not much in the way of tangible rewards for it.  But you, presumably, have a real job that earns you real money to live on.  Maintaining Cadpage is my full time job and I can't keep doing it while living off of retirement funds.  Something has to change.  If I can convince enough Cadpage users to contribute enough to live on, Cadpage can continue with a full time developer.  If not, I have to go out and find a real software job and work on Cadpage in my spare time, which pretty much means only supporting existing location and features.  Just doing that is taking up abut 20 hr/week now.

I love working on Cadpage.  I look on it as a calling and really wish I could keep doing this without bugging people for more money.  Alas, the cold reality is that we have been living off retirement funds for the last year they will only last for another year or two.  Something has to change.  If I can convince enough Cadpage users to contribute enough to live on, Cadpage can continue with a full time developer.  If not, I have to go out and find a real software job and work on Cadpage in my spare time, which pretty much means only supporting existing location and features.  Just doing that is taking up abut 20 hr/week now.

>>>

I am committed to ensuring that everyone one who can use Cadpage will be able to run it.  Which at this point means handing out free subscriptions to anyone who says that can't afford $10.

Or feel free to just stop installing new updates.  The version of Cadpage you have now will let you run it indefinitely. 

Official notice can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support.

Thanks for the feedback,
-Ken

******************************************************************

You don't have to go back to text messages. All you have to do is stop installing new Cadpage releases.  You can run the current version of Cadpage forever, all it will do is display a modest red demo expired notice when time runs out.

And if you ever need something fixed sometime in the future, you can always pay something for it then.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Non-functioning widgets is one of the unresolved mysteries of Cadpage.  It happens sporadically, seems to start and end when a new release is installed, but exact cause is still conjecture.  It never happens on my phone which makes tracking this down challenging.

We put in a fix a while back that seems to help some, but not always :(

Shutting down Cadpage seems to help.  
Main > Menu > Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > Cadpage > Force Stop
Cadpage starts up automatically the next time it is needed, so the force stop has no real effect on how you sew Cadpage working.  But the restart does seem to fix the widget problems.

If you can figure out just what you do that makes the widget go catatonic, I would very much appreciate knowing what that was.

Thanks,
-Ken


******************************************************************

As best we can tell, Oneida county sends dispatch alerts with line breaks between fields.  But at least one of the forwarding services they are using to convert those alerts into SMS text pages is stripping out the line breaks and leaving nothing to separate the data fields.  As a result, they all run together, and there is no way for use to accurately split them out again.

Some users, at some times, have gotten text messages with the line breaks intact.  Other users have gotten text messages with the line breaks have been replaced with '>' symbols.  Both of these can be handled.  But users who get text messages where the line breaks have been removed are SOL.

Someone needs to track down how these dispatch alerts get generated and talk someone into changing things.  If the unidentified forwarding service will either leave the line breaks in place, or replace them with something else, all will be well. If Dispatch can use some other character to separate data fields in the dispatch alerts, it won't matter what the forwarding service does with them.

Good luck,
-Ken

I'm trying to make enough from Cadpage users to keep making this my full time occupation.  I think this is in the users interest, if I can't do this and have to get a real paying job, Cadpage maintenance will decline dramatically.  And the way text formats change all over the time, that would make it unusable for large numbers of people.

I'm asking for $10/year, which isn't very much in terms of how much people usually pay just to have an Android phone.  But I'm also committed to making sure people who can not, or just will not, pay anything can continue to use it.

1) You can roll back to the v1.4.32 version has no real enforcement logic.  If the demo runs out it will just display a demo expired notice and go happily on its way.
2) If you run through the payment status menu, there is a "I can't afford $10" that gives you a chance to send us an email explaining why you can't pay that.  I'm pretty easy with these, as long as you don't insult me I'll probably give you a free 1 year subscription.
3) You can uninstall and reinstall Cadpage, which resets the 30 day demo clock.  You can do this as often as you want. Cadpage tries to make this easier by giving you a Reinstall Cadpage button when the demo expires.

It is also worth mentioning that Cadpage is distributed under an open source license.  Which makes it free software in the "Free Speech", rather than the "Free Beer" sense.  Anyone who doesn't like the way I am running things is free to take the source code and use it to create their own product.

Hope that makes sense.  If you have any better ideas on how we can keep Cadpage running, I would be happy to hear them.
-Ken

***************************************************************************

There are two reasons why we distributed Cadpage as a free app and try to charge for it later.
1) If it was an expensive paid app, not that many people would download it, try it out and find out just how super cool it was.  This gives people a way to try it out first.
2) We don't want anyone to not be able to use Cadpage because they cannot afford, or just don't want to pay for it. There are, and always will be, ways to keep running Cadpage without paying anything.

There is a notice in the product description explaining this, but until recently it was down at the bottom and I can see why people might miss it.  I recently changed that description to make it more prominent.  You can check that out and see if I need to do an even better job.

Thanks for the feedback,
-Ken

OK, this is going to get a bit complicated.

You must be using the general location.  Current versions of Cadpage suspend the evaluation period while you are using the generic location, largely because performance and reliability are so poor and you aren't getting the full benefit of the Cadpage product.  That's what gives you the sponsored by Cadpage message.  If you had a recognized paid subscription along with the General location, it would have reported that.  But when you switched phones and lost the paid subscriber status, it started report the sponsored status rather start report you as having a limited time evaluation demo.

If you were using a supported location before the phone switch, just go into Location settings and select that location.  Then reload the payment status and all should be as it was.

If you were using the general location before the phone switch, there is no real problem, you can run Cadpage like this forever without it bugging you for more money.

Or you can go into Location settings and temporarily select a real location specific location.  That will put you back in demo mode, which will let you reload the payment status which should fix everything.  After which you can switch back to the general location.

But what we really want you to do is request a new location for your area.  That will probably be ready for the next release, and after you switch to that one location you can reload the payment status.

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.   

All of this needs to be emailed to are main support address support@cadpage.org.  If they are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and past them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list and get it added.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the from: filter to whoever appears in the from: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support. 

Have a nice day,
-Ken

I do have concerns about using Cadpage as your primary navigation tool.  It is pretty good, but it is only as reliable as Google maps, and Google maps has some weaknesses.
1) It's ability to accurately find an address accurately goes down substantially in areas where it doesn't have access to property rolls.  Which appears to be the case for your area.
2) It can't find interchanges, overpasses, and mile markers.  This is principally a problem with limited access highways, which are, again, common in your district.
3) It won't tell you about special conditions, like bridge weight limits, that might be in your department map books.  You can remedy this one by setting up custom map layers.

I've been impressed with how well it works, and would actually consider using it as a primary navigation tool in districts like ours, where Google does have access to online property rolls and we have no limited access highways.  But unfortunately your district appears to lack those two conditions.

Still, Cadpage official policy disclaimer reads....

This application should NOT be used as a primary dispatch method. Neither the developers or Google will be responsible for sending you to the wrong address or mapping errors. It is your responsibility to determine if the address looks to be correct and to have an alternate means of verification. This is a supplemental aid only and can be wrong, fail to operate correctly, crash, or in some other way not work as intended which usually happens at the worst time possible. We try to make the app work in the best manner possible and to not crash and in general it should not attract hungry brown bears to your location. However there are no guarantees made.

Have a nice day,

I'm getting several complaints that notification sound doesn't work (unless the Notification Override is on)  Whis is very puzzling because I haven't changed anything about the notification logic for probably more than a year.

Of course, my sound plays with no problems whatsoever, which makes it hard to tell what is going wrong.

In the grasping at straws category, try cycling power on the device.  It's worked before for odd sound problems.

If that doesn't work, we're going to have to look at your system log.  Ty installing a log view (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after you get a Cadpage alert.

Good luck,
-Ken
