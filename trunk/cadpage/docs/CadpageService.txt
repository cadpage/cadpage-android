Specs to support  Cadpage branded paging service

For each user, we will send an phone number, name and MEID device number.  These can 
be used to identify a second request from the same user/device.  Otherwise they are 
informational only.

When looking for a matching device, I would check for a phone number if we sent one, 
otherwise check for a matching MEID number.

Need to keep the standard account and token items.  You send these in the REGISTER
confirmation message.  We send them to you in any subsequent request.

You need to keep an active/inactive binary flag and an expiration date.  We have requests
that update these values.  Lacking any other information, the flag should be set to
inactive if the expiration date has been reached.  Users that are not in an active state 
should not have anything pushed to the device.  Obviously we only pay for users with an
active status.

We have something called a lifetime subscription.  These are people who either sent us money 
back in the very early days before we started enforcing subscriptions, or performed some other
exceptional service.  The numbers are few, less than 200.  I am OK with absorbing the $4 cost
even though they are not paying us are a regular basis.  But wanted to make sure you knew
they might show up.

We need a base URL.  Can be the same as the CodeMessaging base URL or can be different.
