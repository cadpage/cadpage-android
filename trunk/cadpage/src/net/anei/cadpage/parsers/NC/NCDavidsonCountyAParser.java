  // NCDavidsonCountyA and NCRowanCounty are also adjacent counties with similar
  // formats that we make an extra special effort to make sure do not accept
  // each other page formats
  
  // But NCRowanCounty and NCDavidsonCounty are not adjacent, and keeping their
  // page formats mutually exclusive has proven to be impossible, largely because
  // they both use the ROCK city code to mean different things.
  
  // Tentative solution, NCDavidsonCountyA is an alias of NCGuildforCounty with
  // some extra logic to drop NCRowanCounty pages.  When NCDavidsonCounty and
  // NCGuilfordCounty are grouped together, NCDavidsonCounty takes over because
  // it is (fortunately) first alpahbetically and this logic is not executed.
  // When Davidson and Rowan Counties are merged togother, it does take effect.
