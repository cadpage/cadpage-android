Notes:

Simple field program parser subclass

Search for 4 consecutive newlines.  Delete everything from that point on.

Program String: TIME SRC CODE CALL ADDR CITY! 

Time field will need some special stuff to handle the AM/PM code.  Default
TimeField will do this if you pass a pattern and date format code to it.

DateFormat TIME_FMT = new SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm aa");
Look up SimpleDateFormat pattern to make sure I got that right!

in getField() when name equals "TIME" return new TimeField(TIME_FMT, true);

For source code, override field to return new SourceField("NEW EVENT ([A-Z]+)", true);
First parameter is regular expression, lookup up Pattern object for  more details on regular expressions.
Second one will reject parse if pattern is not matched.  If there is a one  pattern group (the stuff in parens)
the the field program parser will use it's contents instead of the entire field, so source will get set to "MPD"
instead of "NEW EVENT MPD".
