NOTES:
Basic DispatchCiscoParser subclass


Only complicate is that they are sending the department as the message subject.  That the leading term in parenthesis.  
But when it gets to the parser it will be the message subject.  To handle that, override
parseMsg(String subject, String body, Data data)
if subject length is zero, return false,
save subject in data.strSource
return super.parseMsg(body, data)

Also override
getProgram()
and return "SRC " + super.getProgram()
This is somethingn we need to do when one of the parseMsg overrides is setting data in a new field.  getProgram() tell the
test generator which fields need to be checked and in what order

Finally, this class needs a city code table passed to constructor.  This is a Properties object, typically named CITY_CODES.  
There is a buildCodeTable method to make it easy to build them.  You have to figure out which code means what.  They are all 
2 character codes found at the end of the address.  Wikipedia entry for Logan County, Ohio is a useful resource to determine
what city/township names might be.  Just covering what look like obvious ones
WL = WEST LIBERTY
WM = WEST MANSFIELD
ZF = ZANESFIELD

Check all of the addresses.  Java regular expressions are good for finding unidentifed 2 character codes at the end of an address
Something like
"ADDR:.* (?!ST|WL|WM|ZF)[A-Z]{2}"
will do for starters
